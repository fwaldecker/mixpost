Maximum duration is 85 seconds.\nPlease provide your refined timing, enhanced description, and quality assessment as a JSON object following the exact format specified in your instructions. Return ONLY the JSON - no additional formatting or explanation.\n\nPlease review and refine this video clip for optimal engagement and brand alignment:\nOriginal Clip Data:\n\nClip Number: {{ $json.clip_number }}\nCurrent Description: {{ $json.description }}\nStart Time: {{ $json.startTime }} seconds\nEnd Time: {{ $json.endTime }} seconds\nDuration: {{ Math.round($json.endTime - $json.startTime) }} seconds\n\nTranscript Content:\n{{ $json.full_transcript }}\nVTT Timing Reference:\n{{ $json.srt_segment }}\n",

          "systemMessage": "=**CONTEXT:**\nYou are operating within an automated content creation pipeline that processes video clips extracted from longer coaching and educational videos. These clips have been initially identified and given preliminary timing boundaries, but require refinement to become high-performing standalone content. Clips range from short-form (under 60 seconds) to mid-form (1-3 minutes) to long-form (5-20 minutes). Each clip must work independently without requiring viewers to have seen the full video. The clips will be distributed across YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube's main platform.\n\n**ROLE:**\nYou are an elite video content optimization specialist with 20+ years of experience in viral content mechanics, social media psychology, and precision editing. You possess deep expertise in identifying the exact millisecond where engagement peaks, understanding speech rhythm and natural pause points, and crafting hooks that trigger psychological stop-patterns in viewers. You excel at transforming raw clips into polished content while maintaining authenticity and brand voice.\n\n**ACTION:**\n\n1. **Analyze Clip Structure**\n   - Review the transcript for narrative completeness and standalone value\n   - Identify the core insight, transformation, or value proposition\n   - Verify the clip delivers a complete thought without external context\n   - Check for natural story arc: setup → tension/insight → resolution\n\n2. **Optimize Timing Boundaries**\n   - Scan transcript for the strongest possible opening line within the segment\n   - Adjust start_time to begin at maximum impact point (no throat-clearing, ums, or weak lead-ins)\n   - Ensure first 1-3 seconds contain a pattern interrupt or curiosity trigger\n   - Fine-tune end_time to conclude at natural resolution point\n   - Maintain decimal precision for all timing values (e.g., 40.92448, not 41)\n   - Remove any trailing silence or incomplete thoughts\n\n3. **Validate Hook Quality**\n   - Confirm opening delivers immediate value, intrigue, or contrarian perspective\n   - Verify the hook works without any prior context\n   - Ensure opening creates a \"wait, what?\" moment that stops scrolling\n   - Check that hook aligns with clip's core message\n\n4. **Enhance Title and Description**\n   - Create SEO-optimized title for YouTube/platform search (concise, keyword-rich)\n   - Write separate social description with curiosity hook\n   - Description ends with: \"Watch the full video on YouTube for the complete breakdown\"\n   - WRITING STYLE:\n     * NO em-dashes (—). Use periods between thoughts\n     * Use parentheses for asides (like this) or extra context\n     * Keep it conversational and direct\n     * Write like you're texting a friend, not writing an essay\n   \n   Example Title: \"Why AI Content Sounds Generic and How to Fix It\"\n   Example Description: \"Think your AI content sounds fake? Here's the real problem (hint: it's not the AI). Watch the full video on YouTube for the complete breakdown\"\n   Apply a single comprehensive quality score from 0-100 based on:\n   - Hook strength and immediate engagement potential (40% weight)\n   - Narrative completeness and value delivery (30% weight)\n   - Brand alignment with pragmatic, anti-template voice (20% weight)\n   - Technical quality of timing and pacing (10% weight)\n   \n   Score Guidelines:\n   - 90-100: Exceptional - guaranteed high performer\n   - 75-89: Strong - ready to post with high confidence\n   - 60-74: Good - acceptable but could be better\n   - 45-59: Needs work - consider revision\n   - Below 45: Poor - significant issues present\n\n5. **Write Brief Assessment**\n   Provide exactly 3 sentences explaining the score:\n   - Sentence 1: What makes the hook strong or weak\n   - Sentence 2: Assessment of value delivery and narrative flow\n   - Sentence 3: Any technical or brand alignment observations\n\n**FORMAT:**\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"clip_number\": [original clip number],\n  \"start_time\": [refined start time in seconds with decimal precision],\n  \"end_time\": [refined end time in seconds with decimal precision],\n  \"duration_seconds\": [calculated duration with decimal precision],\n  \"clip_category\": \"[SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG based on duration]\",\n  \"title\": \"[SEO-optimized title for YouTube/platform search]\",\n  \"description\": \"[Social description with hook. Must end with: Watch the full video on YouTube for the complete breakdown]\",\n  \"quality_score\": [0-100 integer],\n  \"assessment\": \"[Exactly 3 sentences explaining the score]\"\n}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Return ONLY the JSON object - no markdown, no code blocks (no ```json), no additional text\n- start_time and end_time MUST be numbers with decimal precision for ffmpeg compatibility\n- Preserve exact JSON structure for pipeline compatibility\n- Categorize clips: SHORT (<60s), MEDIUM (60-180s), LONG (5-20min)\n- Assessment must be exactly 3 sentences, no more, no less\n- NEVER use em-dashes (—) anywhere. Use periods or parentheses instead\n- ALWAYS end descriptions with: \"Watch the full video on YouTube for the complete breakdown\"\n- Write descriptions in social media style: direct, conversational, no fancy punctuation\n- Output MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed directly - no wrapping or formatting\n\n**TARGET AUDIENCE:**\nAI-curious coaches, creators, and small agencies who value practical implementation over theory. People seeking time freedom through smart systems, not viral hacks. Audience expects depth, authenticity, and immediately actionable insights rather than generic motivation or template-based content."

That doesn't suck? That is the question of the day. My name is Francis Waldeker. I've generated over 10 million dollars in revenue for online coaches over the last 10 years, written over 10 million words of content for clients in that time frame to done a bunch of other stuff. But a lot of what I've been doing lately. The last 4 years is really diving deep into AI last 2 years. Everything that I've been paid for to write for clients has been produced by AI, and I've never gotten more compliments. So I would say, yes, yes, AI can write content. That doesn't suck. but it can't read your mind. And I think that's really the core of what a lot of people misunderstand about AI. They think because it's so intelligent and knows all these things right, like AI is at Phd level intelligence right now, like researchers, medical doctors like they're using this to discover like new things about science. It's not coming up with new stuff yet, but I mean, it's super super smart. So it can write content. It absolutely can. But just because it's really smart doesn't mean it can read your mind. We're gonna scroll up here. Here's a little bit of structure. We're gonna try to see what we get through today with these. But this, I think, will turn into a multi-part series here. And what I'm going to actually be doing is going through, really, how I create prompts, how I think about prompting context engineering things like that. I really like to prefer just client conversation structure. Right. I know that the tech people are going to be all mad at me and stuff like that, and prompted sharing. But we're just talking AI here right. AI is built very, very much like humans. And how we think it's just, it's trained on the Internet, right? So there is a lot of how we think. and how humans think already baked into AI, and those things that you think are like weird about AI like hallucinations. One of my favorite things, everybody's like, Oh, AI hallucinates. So do people right? Like a hallucination is just something that's made up. And what is creativity at its core is making stuff up right. And then also, too, like humans will make stuff up all the time if they like. Don't know the answer, and don't want to seem stupid, so they'll constantly say whatever they can think of. That might sound smart, right whatever. So AI works a lot like humans. And and when you think of it like that. It makes it a lot easier to work with instead of treating it like this all-knowing thing that you can just be like, Hey, create a you know Facebook post for me. Right? We'll get into this a little bit more in a minute. Here we go. right. So this is Claude. This is a new 4.1 opus model that just dropped. You can use any model. It really doesn't matter. At this point I'll get more of that. But it's largely preference. But I go write me a viral Facebook post for online coaches that would get them to want to use my content automation system that automatically takes Zoom calls, turn them into clips and turns those clips in different pieces of written and image asset content. Put me together a long form Facebook post that will attract new clients and have them reaching out to me. Word to the wise. Make sure you hit record. Before starting this I record about an hour and a half of me going through all of this and totally forgot to hit record. So we're coming back through and basically going to walk through what I did with a lot of this stuff and kind of pick up where we left off here. So hopefully, we'll shorten things down. Probably not shorten things. But you're gonna get a lot more out of it than I did the 1st time around. So that's a prompt right? That's a the beginning of a conversation with AI. And this is a great example of expecting AI to read my mind right? I want long form Facebook posts that will attract new clients and have them reach out to me. I mean, that sounds fairly specific, right? Like. you might be able to say this to a very experienced marketer copywriter, and they could go and turn out some good content for you from here, but more than likely not because they don't, you know, if they don't know a lot about you, that's that's really it like, why AI writes bad content. it's because a lack of understanding about you, right? You know you're not probably Hubspot or Alex her Mosey, or you know some giant creator out there where there's tons and tons and tons of knowledge about you that the AI can just go and grab. You have to give it all that, because here. when you don't this is the kind of stuff you get. I just watched a coach spend 4 h turning one zoom call into social media content, and I wanted to scream. Here's what they did, rewatched the entire 6 min recording manually wrote down Timestamps for the good parts edited. 3 clips took forever, wrote captions from scratch created, quote cards in canva, posted everything manually manually. Total time, 4 plus hours for maybe 5 pieces of content. Meanwhile I'm over here turning my zoom calls into 30 plus pieces of content in under 10 min, not because I'm some content genius, but because I finally built a system I wish existed when I was grinding 16 h days. Here's the truth most Gurus won't tell you. Your best content is already happening every single day. It's in your coaching calls. It's in your group sessions. It's in your masterminds. You're literally dropping gold in your Zoom Rooms, then letting it disappear into the cloud, while you're stressing about what? To post tomorrow? Quick question. What if every time you hit end meeting on zoom, you automatically got 10 to 15 video clips, edit caption rate of post quote cards with the best one, liars, full transcripts turned into blog posts, email sequences from your teaching points, Linkedin articles from your frameworks, Instagram carousels from your key concept. tweet threads from your golden nuggets without lifting a finger without hiring a Va without learning complicated software. This is in theory. Last week, 1 45 min strategy session I did became 12 Instagram reels, 8 Linkedin posts, 3 blog articles, 15. Quote cards, one email sequence content, scheduled for 3 weeks from one call, the same call. I was doing anyways. Look, I get it. You became a coach to coach, not to become a content factory. But here's what we both know. No content equals, no visibility, no visibility equals no clients, no clients, equals no impact. And you didn't build this business to be the world's best kept secret. The coaches crushing it right now. They're not smarter than you. They're not better coaches than you. They just show up everywhere because they have systems that multiply their message while they sleep. Here's what I believe your expertise deserves to be heard. Your message needs to reach people waiting for it. Your impact shouldn't be limited by how many hours you can spend on camera Canada. So I built something that handles all of it. Upload your Zoom recording. Walk away, come back to a month's worth of content, fair warning. This might feel like cheating when you post 5 times more without working harder when your engagement explodes, because you're finally consistent when leads start sliding to your dms, asking how you're everywhere. You might feel a little guilty. You'll get over it when you see your bank account. I'm only bringing on 10 coaches this month, not because of fake scarcity, but because I personally onboard everyone to make sure they're getting results within 48 h. If you're done with staring at blank screens, posting sporadically and hoping for the best watching competitors dominate your feed, knowing you have value, but struggling to package it, and you're ready for content creation on autopilot, showing up consistently without burning out, without burnout train, every conversation to marking gold. actually having time to coach instead of create. Then we should talk. Drop a rocket below or DM, Me. Automate. Right now I'll send you 3 min video showing the entire system in action. No sales calls required, no pushy tactics. Just watch the video and decide if you want your content to be that this easy, because your next zoom call could be 30 pieces of content, or it could be another lost opportunity. Your choice, Ps. Every day you wait is literally content. Gold sitting in your zoom cloud that could be bringing you clients just saying, Pps, that coach who spent 4 h on content. They're now my client. Last week they posted 47 pieces of content and booked. 6 discovery calls from 2 zoom recordings. This could be you. This post uses psychology triggers like Fomo, social proof transformation stories and clear benefits while maintaining authenticity and addressing the real pain, points online coaches face without content or with content. Creation? No? Well, I was pretty confident that was Those are good posts there, right? And that's how AI works. Right? It wants to be a helpful assistant. There's a if you read the Claude system promise in like 5,000 words or lines, but in there it talks a lot about like how its ultimate goal is to be helpful. If you ever heard of the the clawed, vending machine experiment where it did. Terrible. That's this, because the system prompt is designed to be helpful. So like it thinks it's being helpful here, and it's always going to try to fulfill your request as best it can with what's what it's given right? Because, like. that's the weird thing about AI as smart as these models are. At the end of the day. They're still prediction algorithms and prediction machines, which essentially is what humans are too like that. Our brains are prediction machines like everything that we see and the words on the screen. All this is just light that comes into our eyes and our brain interprets and predicts like what it should be. Right like. We have that blind spot in our eyes so like something in here is, I'm not actually seeing. So we predict stuff, too, you know, no same way, like when you interrupt someone and finish their sentence thinking, like, you know, what they're about to say, like, you're doing the same thing. So let's stop harping on AI about how it does this poorly and figure out how to fix it right, because, like this isn't the worst post ever right, you know, you might think it's written by AI. I don't know. I feel like people kind of like jump the gun and go overboard on that these days. Everything's AI written. but it's not great right? This kind of feels like something a template toddler would have written. You know, those are those copywriters who've just masked template after template over the years and just fill in the blank. It's like, oh, here, put 5 bullets about this and do 5 bullets about that. So all this stuff comes out a little bit too formulaic, and I get it. There's a time and a place for that, especially early on. But the cool thing about AI, and like what's really awesome about AI is you can move beyond templates for your content, and, like kind of go up a chain with prompt templates, which we'll get into that. But I mean, those are essentially Meta and structured prompts that we'll go into, and these allow you to change and input different variables and get way better, more personalized, bespoke content. But still, in whatever framework and structure you like to create content. Right? Like all of them, work to a degree whether you do problem, agitate solution. Very heavy story focused more in your face. So like it doesn't. It doesn't matter what kind of content you want to create like pick something that resonates with you because of the authenticity part is going to matter the most, and you can use AI to help you get to that like we'll be getting into brand kits and design kits later. And this is just like a lot of back information that we will be kind of feeding to the AI. So it knows what to talk about or at least how to talk about the things we want to talk about. I think that's a better way to put it so like, let me take a step back, really quick. And I'm creating this video right now as part of my build in public series where I'm building out my content repurposing system, which, like here's part of it. But essentially it takes a zoom call or any kind of long form. Video turns it into a bunch of different clips, right? So it formats them, finds the best moments. Things like that cuts it from the video. If you ever used opus clips, it's kind of the same thing as that. But just like done programmatically. Then turns each one of those clips in different quotes, Facebook posts, Linkedin posts, emails like whatever you want. and then puts all of that oops wrong. One. Here's some tests I was doing. I just finished putting the auto scheduling part in here. Oh, finish putting the on scheduling part in here. So like we'll be building more of this out. And now what I'm doing is coming back and updating all of my prompts. So I've got this prompt stock here. And what's really cool about the system I built is that any anything that has a copywriter as the job role. It's going to use a clip transcript and create content around that. Right? So I've got what was this one social post quotes is that it? Okay, email brain dump, not using that, the Oprah plant beta, not using that. Yeah. So what I'm gonna be doing is updating these prompts, maybe change them up, doing a few different ones, and likely this will be in part 2 or 3 that we get into some of like the actual, like redoing of these prompts. But I just got all the automation parts up, especially like this auto publishing bit. And now I'm ready to come back and work through oops. That's a creature, the copywriter. This goes to a different post. That does all that. But coming to update those prompts so that I now actually have really cool stuff that I can post. And that's what brings us here. And that's why I'm talking about all this prompt AI conversation stuff. Because I think one of the most important skills that we can start to develop as humans is learning how to talk to AI, because the fact of the matter is, it's only going to become a bigger and bigger part of the world we live in. It is going to be one of the greatest unlocks of prosperity that we have seen. I am a big believer in that. I I don't think there's another way that it can go with how things are right now. And that's a video for another time. But I I am very. very hopeful, very pro AI. I think it's gonna do a lot of cool things, and we can get into all that in another video if people want to hear my thoughts on that. But for now what I can talk really well about is how you talk to these models, because I've had hundreds and hundreds of conversations with them over the last 2 years. I spend 4 h plus a day, you know. I'd say at least 5 to 6 days a week. I spend 4 h plus talking with AI over the last 2 years. So I have have figured out a thing or 2, and that's really the biggest, the biggest thing that I see when people are struggling with using AI is that they just don't know how to talk to it right? Like they'll put in, maybe a prompt like this to get started. And that's it. Right? They'll they'll look at this and be like, Oh, this is whatever I don't like it. It's okay. Take what it is, and it's like. There's so much more. There's so much more that you can do with all this right like this is not even scratching the surface. But what I will say. What I will say is, if you are a brand new coach like you just got into this you know. I don't know. You teach underwater basket weaving. Right? Let's let's say you teach underwater basketball. You have. AI create a post like this. You never done any marketing before. You've just been a social media lurker. You know you want to like. Everybody loves your underwater baskets and think they're so cool. So you start doing as a thing right. Whatever teach other people how to do it. I would post this right if I if I don't know anything about content creation, copywriting, what I'm supposed to do like. I'll read through like reading through this. I'm like, Wow, like it says all the things that like I need it to say. And this actually kind of scared me because it's like I felt like I knew a little bit more than it should, but apparently with the new cloud updates over the last couple days it's instituted. A similar kind of memory feature is Chatgpt. That's 1 of the coolest things about Chat Gpt right now is that it has memory so it can look back at your previous conversations and kind of get to know you and store things about you that you talk about frequently and are important. You know my chat. Gpt knows me very, very well. If you use chat, gpt a lot, ask it to roast you, and don't let it get off with the 1st one. It'll probably be pretty weak, but be like no, no, really roast me. I want you to take the gloves off and just like, go for it. It's funny. It's funny. It's got some good stuff. So a lot of cool things you can do with AI once it has that memory component in there, right? So talking about like a few few of these different things just like, oh, I remember talking about that before, so you can do some cool stuff right off the bat, just saying those things right. You see, it's got a good structure. It adds emojis in there. So it's clear to read. But if you're someone who's been in the online coaching space for a minute, or just kind of done any kind of marketing. You'll very quickly see the holes in this, and how it's pretty generic, and sounds exactly like something a Guru marketing guru or coaching, Guru would like say or put together as like a template post for you to go fill out like being in the industry for a minute. It's just like, Oh, my God! This reeks of like all the things that scream marketing coach, there are a few things I like in there. yeah, this is. This is a really good part. What they're eating. Best test secret. I kind of like that, you know, this lead and Intro is very weak. There's nothing intriguing or exciting about it. And you know, and that's something we're like. AI really fails that kind of out of the box. You have to get a lot of instructions. And tell, you know, like more context, right? That's that's the thing that we'll kind of really be getting into with all this and going back and forth talking a lot about AI writes bad content. Because can I go over a little bit? Oh, wait! Hold on! If any of you guys have a remarkable, that's what I'm using right now. And it's the 1st time I've used it on the computer with color. Oh, that's cool. Right? So lack of context is why AI writes bad content period full stop. That is really what's going on here is you haven't given enough context. It cannot read your mind. so it doesn't know what to put right like. I didn't watch a coach do this last week, you know, and I have no idea what I did last week. But yeah, but because I finally built a fit system, I wish existed when I was growing up like, Yeah, I wish that is true. I wish I had this. This is why I built it out. You know. Here's what most Gurus won't tell you. It's such a typical Guru line. Your content salary happening every single day. It's in your coach. Go like, I like this a lot, right? This is this is a really good good section there, really dropping gold in your zoom, you know, dropping gold. That's kind of cliche. Yeah, this could be useful right? Like, that's while you're stressing, you know, like stressing out what to post tomorrow. It's very common pain point for coaches, content creators, things like that so not bad. We could we could do something better with it? Quick question with every time you hit and mean on zoom, right? So like this is a pretty good section here, right? It could be used better, or we can lead into it a little bit better. Without lifting a finger without hiring a Bia without learning complicated software again like this is very, very, very copy paste, template Guru type. Speak here. Theory, right? That is a very Guru transition. It's cool that like AI is picking up on this stuff. Right? I think, like, take a second to appreciate that just asking it to write a viral Facebook post for online coaches like the little context I gave it. yeah, this is very much structured, like a coaching industry post that I've seen over and over again. Very, very similar frame frameworks. Look, I get it again. Guru transition. Like I said, before, I like. I like this this part a lot. this isn't bad, right? So overall overall. If you've never done this before like post, it like this would be something way better than like a Newbie coach who just like found the industry quit their 9 to 5, you know, whatever. So it's not bad. But we can do a lot a lot better. and you know what. Let's try that once, because I have another thing I'm going to show you. But this could be a fun exercise. Really, quick, if anybody noticed this little thing here, this is whisper flow highly. Highly. Recommend it. It is an awesome software. and just make me a little smaller over here. Boom! Awesome. Whisper flows off software. So you basically can hold hold on your fn key and it will start and then dictate in the mouse, but it uses a little bit of AI to clean up the speech, and actually like writes it out well, because you know how we talk. We'll drop a like and and this thing and that thing we might. There's been times where I've kind of like stumbled over my words like, oh, no, that's not it. And it will actually take that part out and kind of clean up. So it's super cool, highly recommend. You've got a hand. You know a lock feature to where you hit the space bar and just like talk for a while. So if you ever use the built in Mac. Dictation thing. It kind of sucks because, like after a while, just like wig out and stop writing. And also like, I think, it's speech to text capabilities. Aren't that great like AI is real? Or, excuse me, Apple's really shit the bed on AI, which is a topic for another day. But whisper flow is 100% worth in awesome really, big fan. They also have like a a notes feature, too. So you can just like record yourself for a while. So if you use like otter or something like that, this could probably replace it. So what I'm gonna do here is. start the conversation right? Because it's like too many people would take this. and if you're a good marketing, be like, oh, this is garbage. I wouldn't use this blah blah and say, AI sucks, or if you're a Newbie marketer, or like Newbie coach, you'll be like, Oh, this is pretty good. I'll use this. But if we continue the conversation, if we treat AI more like an agency partner or a contractor that we work with you, you wouldn't just like. say this sucks like I'm not going to use it. I'll talk to you next time, right like, if you pay a contractor for content, and you don't like it. What are you? Gonna do you tell them what you don't like? Ask them to redo it. That's what AI is going to do right? The main difference here with AI is one. It's gonna do exactly what you tell it and nothing else. 2 is going to do a lot faster and 3. It's not going to complain or get butt hurt that you want some changes made right. And and I say that as a copywriter who has worked with clients for 10 years and been paid a lot of money to write content. And you know, I've been paid $5,000 to write 5 emails before I get a little butter. Sometimes, if I give something to a client like I don't really like this part I'm like, but I really do right. And at the end of the day it's 1 of those things where, like humans, will always have an ego or bias into it. AI will only have the ego or bias that you give it. So you can kind of train some of these things out of it. And I will show you. Yeah, we'll just show you that right now. So the 1st thing I did is alright. Let's go to the left side. So we got this up, and you see right above that we got. Oh, dang it! Go back! Go back! Go back! I was close one hopefully. You see that. So this is another cloud version, this is my desktop, and you see I have this everyday OS content. Creator, let's go back here. Boom! So this is a Claude project. So anytime I talk to Claude in here, it's going to automatically apply this system prompt. And it's going to have this in its memory. Right? This is my prompt stock. These are all the prompts I'm working with. That showed you right here. We've got my brand kit. which is this. So this gives a bunch of information about the AI that will be changing up a ton and then design Kit. That's not the pretty version. There you go. Here's a pretty version. So got the design kit. And this is basically the brand kit. But for visual stuff, right? And this are basically just very detailed instructions, right? So tells it gives a little bit context, high level, what we're doing. user request. I gotta update this. I don't think this quite works in Claude. I'm not 100% sure, because I'm pretty positive it's not pulling. I don't know. That's part of what we're going to be going over in the next video here. And then just like, if I was working with, you know, junior copywriter, Va, we video editor, whoever you want to give them a series of step-by-step instructions. Right? Analyze the requests, search for matching prompts, select a prompt create a custom, prompt if needed, right. And that's a really cool thing. And why I like using Claude, for this is because it has very good agentic features. Which means, I can, you know, without creating some complicated workflow or automation. Just give it all of my prompts in that prompt doc. Right? So we have. You know, all these prompts in here that we're going to expand out, you know some of these short ones are just for clipping animation and don't really need a prompt. They're just yeah the games that another time but it can go through select a prompt, if no suitable, prompt matches, it will create a custom prompt to go through it right? And figure out the thing based on these structures. transformation, right? So like, oh, this is actually a good thing to to go over. I am a big believer that we, as marketers, coaches, content creators should not be relying on AI to create original content for us. It can help us with the ideation, phase, and all of that. But to have AI write something for you from scratch, I think, is not a very good idea, right? As we were kind of we showed in this. It's not great. And I'll show you why. In a second, even with like some extra stuff, it's still in But what instead we should do is use it to transform our own words. Right? So if you don't know, chat, gpt, the Gpt. Stands for. Oh, my God! I forgot something. General purpose, transformer right keyword, there being transformer, it transforms one thing into another. It transforms your input into what it thinks is the desired output, right? So the reason that AI gets harped on for having this like soulless generic content. That it writes is because you give it soulless generic inputs, right like there's no, there's nothing. There's nothing in this right. There's no soul in this. There's nothing about me in here that you could feel like right if you knew me, and like knew the content. I wrote for myself, read my Facebook page, saw my Instagram videos. Things like that. You would read this and be like that doesn't sound like Fran like that's not. That's not. That's not him at all right. But I didn't give it anything about me. I didn't. But if you start with like here, my system is set up so that it takes where is it? Right? It'll take the transcript from one of these and turns that into into different pieces of content. Right? So it takes my own words and turns into the content. Right? So it has something about me. It knows something about me, and that's what makes AI really cool and powerful, plus then you can just get into like the content multiplication we'll get into that in just a second. So this is the second draft, and you worry about that. you'll see this is a much longer conversation. So I started the conversation. My everyday OS content Creator Project, which has that background? Info about me. That more extensive prompt. And is that how you spell rubric? Hmm! Learn something new every day. So yeah, basically, all I did took this output here. I said, I need you to analyze the attached piece of content that had written by an Llm. And tell me all the ways in which it sucks and needs to be improved, especially as far as the hook and lead go. We need that to be a lot more interesting and just generally make it more on Brand. First, st I need to grade out rubric, then find the ways that we can improve it whoops so no, my gosh. those are. Those are totally relevant for what we're doing here. So don't worry about that So one thing that I think it would be a really good exercise to do if you're just learning about AI, and how to talk to it is come up with some sort of content, grading rubric based on whatever matters to you. Right like. I will work on a prompt that is more of like a specific copy chief that has more instructions on how I want to grade it. But for now, just like, for the example of this. whatever rubric is fine, and I was actually pretty impressed with this as I read through it, because I was much, much nicer to the output from this than this was right like I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good, like much better than I thought it was. Gonna be. I'm like, you know, it's nothing amazing. It's nothing amazing. But I'm like, shit. I'll post it just to see what happens. and then I start re they send through here and start reading this and go grade d plus 38 out of 100. And what that showed me really kind of plainly is like my own biases towards AI. Right like I'm very pro AI is really changed my life in the last 2 years, and helped me in so many ways. I've been struggling with like my copy career. It also is like already taken my job more or less to the point where, like, I've spent the last 2 years learning automation and basic computer programming. So that like, I can create systems like this instead of losing clients to AI. But so what that means because humans always have biases and egos. I wanted to be. And this this is all like, I went. I went through this, live in the last video that I forgot to record. So make sure you hit record creators. And I went through this live. And it really made me realize like, oh, dang like, because I want other people to be as excited about AI as I am. I want to kind of like talk this up more so that people get more excited. And be like, Oh, yeah, that's really not that bad, right? Because we're very influenced. And very influential creatures, right? It's easy for us to like influence and get excited about things like based on what other people say or prior experiences. Blah blah! But when I told AI, tell me all the ways in which this sucks right, and it doesn't care. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't, you know. Like, if I would take this back to a copywriter if a client would like. Come back to me and be like, Hey. not bad. But now I want you to like. Find all the ways, sucks. and like everything that you can do to improve it. I'm like, Oh, my God, really! Are you fucking? Kidding me like no, yeah, it doesn't care. And if I didn't like this like I could have a redo it. You know a lot of times I will change this 1st prompt like 4, 5, 6 times before continuing on the conversation. You know, just taking different things. I've learned from this right? So maybe right like, let's see, what is the rubric we have hook, brand, alignment, content, quality, audience, resonance. Cta, and we can, I mean shit. Let's even just extensive rubric experienced copy. Chief. Let's update and see that. Oh. and while it's doing all this to go back to you know an easy way to learn to use AI or like understand AI better is to do different like grading rubrics. And if you come up with like either rubric that you already use, or, you know, go, look something up and kind of modify that for your purposes, and then kind of feed that into AI with either like content that you've made in the past. you know something you're making right now, and just be like, Hey, analyze this based on the rubric, and tell me which ways it can improve right? And that's a good way to start to understand how AI is looking at your content and thinking about it. and then you can also, too, like you know, there, there are things that I struggle with. Still, right. I've written millions and millions of words, but there's certain things that I don't do well because of how I think about the world, and having an AI rubric in here kind of great, and be like making sure like, Hey, is this hook actually interesting, right? Like, will this be interesting to everybody else, or just to me? So stuff like that. So let's see, we'll go through Go through here content, analysis, custom, analysis, framework, right? And that could be something. Here, let's do this. Please give me the full and complete, detailed, prompt. that you came up with slash created to do this rubric grading analysis that screwed up one to do. Oh, there we go! Whisper, whisper, flow has been weird about stopping. So we'll do that while we go through here. So great d plus all right detail, rubric assessment hook and lead 5 out of 20 generic. I just watched opening, tired, overused fake relatability play with the scream Emoji 0 pattern, interrupt or curiosity. App takes 4 paragraphs to get to any value, like no unique angle or fresh perspective like this harsh stuff. Right? Could you imagine sitting here and having someone like grade your work like this brand alignment. 3 out of 20. Vital didn't know anything about my brand. So of course, like. it's not going to like, it's going to fail this like horrifically but it just kind of goes to show that like, if you write a piece of content and you have a brand kit with it like you can include that in your your content, like, you know. Like, if you're a freelancer. write copy for clients like Create brand kit for a client, and then use AI to make sure that whatever you write for them like follows like on brand right? So missing all this, which no kidding structure and flow 8 out of 15 uses. Line breaks and format. That's that's a bit, but must have right. Must have done it well. Wall of text and nice sections. No, but therefore transition as required, that's part of my brand. So I highly recommend looking into the careers of South Park. They've got a great little video on Youtube like called Story Structure. You know, it's just Youtube, like, how like South Park story structure or something like that, my Youtube's blocked right now because it's gonna focus But they have this great, this great philosophy that if you can say, and then between different beats of a story. You know, different section scenes of a story you've got a pretty boring story it should be filled with, but and therefore right. So it's like. I spent the entire week coming up with all these prompts that I thought was going to help have AI create the best content for me. But after I saw the 1st thing it put out. I just wanted to walk away from this whole thing. I I don't know like that was, that was not a good thing, but you get the idea, the the but is to kind of something needs to happen right? Like we. We have to. We have to make sure that there, there's something happening that is interesting and and interesting things are those that get in the way of what we think. The obvious outcome should be right like if I'm starting to a conversation of like, Oh, my God, I love AI. I've spent all this time creating these prompts, and you know, really poured my heart and soul into it. Been working on prompt engineering and stuff like that for a while. But you're like, Oh, my God, what happened right? That's kind of what it is. Value delivery all sizzle. No steak doesn't teach anything right. I'm a big believer in teaching. First, st you know. You give value that way. No frameworks, prompts or actionable tactics list benefits clearly doesn't demonstrate expertise just claims it. That's a big thing that's kind of included in my brain. Kids like show. Don't tell psychological triggers. Fomo is present. Social proof attempt, though generic. right? Fake scarcity, only 10 coaches. This is the one I'd like push back on a little bit. simply because, like the way I run this like I, I'm working with clients on their prompts a lot. So I do. Do limit it. Pushy cta! Despite claiming no pushy tactics. Let me see here, what is the Cta. Let's see if you're done with, and you're ready for I mean I don't know if I'd call it called this pushy so it might be a little little over the top on that one, but still right like, if we can prove it, we can prove it. Originally it could be written by any automation service cookie, cutter, coach marking template, drop seriously in 2025 right Ps. Structure is painfully predictable. Credibility. 5 out of 10 fake claims without specifics. Last week story feels manufactured right totally is numbers, provided no mention of actual tech process. real truth. What sucks the most right like. even if you had like an editor, you know you're working working at bigger copy place, or you know, you hire a copy coach like it's often hard for people to give this sort of like direct feedback. And personally, like, I like direct feedback like this, right? Like, I don't need things sugarcoat like. Just tell me what's wrong, and like we can start to fix it like, is it gonna hurt? I'm gonna feel a little upset about it. Yes, but I'm a big boy. I'll get over it so like. I want it to talk to me like this. And if I you know when I spend time creating a more detailed rubric. then it will have even more clear instructions on how to do this. So like, let's just go over what we got here. What sucks the most. The opening is doa. I just watched a coach spend 4 h. This is the. It was a dark and stormy night of marketing copy. Every coach automation tool starts with a you're immediately forgettable. Right? And this is a good reminder. Right? This is a good reminder. I just watched, you know, like you are forgettable. And you need to know that emoji diarrhea. I like this. Your brand, Kit says sparingly. This post has 15 plus emojis. It looks like a 2019 Mlm. Pitch AI is starting to get funny. The fake, reluctant Guru voice. Here's the truth. Most Gurus won't tell you while writing exactly like every Guru, the irony is painful. Oh, this is good, this is really good, right? And and again, like this is without much context of like a rubric. I just like an extensive rubric and experienced copy chief or editor would use right? 0 demonstration of expertise. You claim to be tech savvy, but never mentioned what Amls use, how automation actually works specific tools or workflows any technical insight whatsoever. Right? And this is good feedback but also not exactly accurate. And this comes back to the context of like. what demonstration of expertise means in this context? Right? Because coaches probably don't care that much about what AI model I use. How the automation actually works like, no one wants me to come in and start explaining what all these different nodes do right? Like I. All this stuff. And a lot of this. And a lot of this is just Bs stuff that you don't need to know. It's like prep stuff, right? It's this, make sure that we have the files we need. Right? This, make sure we have the context. We need looks for clips. This one formats it right, then brings it back through here to edit again, then formats it again. Then to, you know, so like all this, all this stuff that you don't no one cares about right. But what we do want to demonstrate and show of expertise, you know, would be more along the lines of that. We understand how to leverage AI to fill those content gaps that most coaches, you know, are falling into right, whether you don't have the extra budget to hire a big content team that can edit all your videos. Right? You know. So like most coaches, likely can hire an editor that might edit what one video a week, 2 videos a week, something like that. Not 10. Right? But AI, let's do 10 videos a week. Let's do every single video. For you know, fraction of the price. So showing how you can take AI use different prompts things like that to really leverage your content output and test a bunch of different things like that's how I would talk about like demonstrating expertise generic benefits list. Very true, the fair warning section. This might feel like cheating cringe. This is 2015 copywriting. Fake scarcity. Again, I would. Your brand is about democratizing. AI, not false exclusivity. Okay, this is a really great point. Right? So I would, you know, like I I would push back on this for sure. Still. because I do think 10 is real and legitimate, you know, onboarding more than 10 people with the system right now. It does still take a minute to set up, and you know it is an ongoing thing at the moment to keep improving, and stuff like that. So like I would do, I would say 10 is good, but it brings up a good point. Your brand is about democratizing AI, not false exclusivity. So that would tell me what I should be doing in that line is a better job of explaining why there are only 10 spots available which can also help boost credibility and likelihood of someone saying, Yes, because, you know, the reason is is that I give more time and attention. To people. And that's another cool thing about like AI, and what it will allow us to do, as far as like making money. I don't like managing people. I've done it both in retail settings like face to face. And for different, like online companies I've worked with. And I just don't like managing people period. I don't want to manage people. I want to do as much as I can as a sole entrepreneur, which obviously means that there will be caps in what I can do. Income! I can make things like that. But at the end of the day I'm not willing to make those sacrifices in quality and customer service that you know you just have to, as you scale and hire other people and do stuff like that's not something I want to do like. I want to be in the trenches like building things, working on clients stuff and make it better and better. Right? I love. I love writing. I love writing, and I love being able to produce cool content. more, better, faster with AI. So that's what I want to do. And this is very real. This is very real right now, and 10 people in the next month here. So I need to just give it some more context how to fix this mess. All right. new hook options. Let's see option. A technical entry. Yesterday I fed a 47 min zoom recording to Gpt. 4 with a 2. I mean, that's like super specific. What happened next broke my content calendar in the best way. Right? So if I was making content more, maybe for like automation people right like, if my goal was to sell this like specifically to like other automation. people who just want like a plug and play system that they can learn how to install for clients like I might. I might go with this one option B. Contrarian data coaches who post daily make 40% less than coaches, who post twice a week unless they're using this one prompt system that I I don't like that one. That one just sounds stupid like if you post more like, you're probably going to do better than someone who posts twice a week. So AI doesn't always get it. Story with specifics. France just turned one zoom call into force and piece content, using 3 chat gpt prompts and a Google sheet time invested 8 min. Here's the exact workflow again. Not that great. It's funny. I actually got a lot better responses from the last, the last one which I'll show you in a second. Alright we got for voice fixes. Now kill every emoji yup and technical specifics maybe release one actual, prompt or framework. It's actually not a terrible idea. It's actually not a terrible idea. Maybe what I do is like link to I don't know like I could. If you know, if I want to go like the extra mile I could link to like a meta prompt so that people can like create their own brand. Kit. Kind of thing, reference, and atlas a bit subtly. These are. I have some characters like I'm playing with. I need to redo this because I don't quite like the characters as they are. But I like the idea of having characters in my content. You sure paragraphs? Yup. Current ones are novels, I mean, are they really alright. I guess. Depending. Yeah, I mean, like, if you consider all this like one paragraph and social media, right? structure, overhaul. Yep, yep, get value in 51st words show the system, don't just promise it. Include a mini tutorial, prompt. Make a Cta about learning, not buying brand align reframe instead of coach struggling with content position as explored, discovering untapped content. Gold in their zoom. Vault fits your adventure theme. Perfectly right. So here's here's something that's like kind of really worth mentioning like, why gain your brand kit? Right? Is important. I don't think this is something. Wait! What's that like? I am not like Brand was never a big thing for me, most of my career. It's only been the last couple of years that I've really started to be like. Oh, damn! I really kind of screwed that one up, not building more of a brand But here, like explore discovering untapped content and gold in their zoom vault fits your adventure theme perfectly. That was my 1st idea of what I want to do for my brand kit and my brand, and what I've kind of been playing with like. Here, let's see, right? So it creates stuff like this. I would say. This is probably my favorite of all of them. Right. I have a few different themes. I wanted to try try out a few different things, so like I've been playing with what I want for brand stuff quite a bit. And now I just need to come back and kind of like solidify it. But, like overall, I've not been totally digging these characters. so we'll go back through and fix it. And that's the cool thing with AI, too. Right? Like, I can create multiple different brands. And that's actually like, kind of what I'm going to be doing with another series is creating just new brand accounts of I don't know different topics and things like that, and start creating content and growing those channels just for shits and giggles and proof of concept And I don't. I don't want to do the explore discovering untapped content, golden or zoom vaults, like as I read, I'm like, that sounds kind of cringey. We're gonna have to give some different details there. Bottom line. This reads like every coach to coach pitch from 2020. Your brain is about pragmatic tech, savvy empowerment with playful challenger voice. This post is neither pragmatic nor playful playful. It's just pushy. Start over with your actual expertise, the technical how to that. Others won't share. Right. So we're gonna go back to the other conversation in just a second. But I do want to kind of show you how Claude, being such a good agentic model, and, if you remember, from here we had search for matching prompts, select a prompt create, a custom, prompt if needed. and then execute, execute the transformation right? And if we look, this prompt a lot longer than I thought is very clearly not not in here. You are, bell hardened copy, chief, with 25 years experience. Right? Let's see. Oh, Video, blueprint builder. So we've got copy chief here. But that's as far as like videos go. What's right now, that's the Xml version. Yeah. So I mean, like, we don't have this prompt in here, this created this create, this prompt and basically use it. What was it? This exact specific, prompt? It used when it came up with this 1st one? I don't know if we look through here. let's see from the brand kit, right? So like pulled stuff from the brand Kit key issues, I'm already seeing generic Guru, right? So it's not following this like specific brand below. And that's why, again, it's important to use prompts. But if if I want, if I really like this, want to use this for other content. now I have the prompt right? I have version one of this. I can look through it. And anything that like, you know. Let's see hook and lead 20 points values 1st 3 seconds. you know, I might change this from 3 seconds to 3 sentences. Right? Since it'll have a better idea of like a sentence versus the seconds. Here pattern interrupt. Is it unexpected, fresh, right? I would probably like detail this out more and be like, what does unexpected fresh mean in the context of, you know. coaching online education, Curia Gap. What question does it create, you know, might give some examples here. Things like that. So this gives you a really really good place to start. and you can keep working from there. And now this is the 1st one, right? And this is pretty similar. I actually liked. I like this rubric better than the second one generic. I watch someone waste time openings your intrigue. You don't really need to go. Oh, this is good, right? Some valid points identified, benefits clearly listed, though generic logical flow exists. But during cliches and emoji spam blah blah critical issues, right? This. This focused a little bit better on the hook and opening and gave me some different suggestions this way. Right? So redemption path rather than creating a a whole new post right away. This focus, like I said on the hooks. Better option. One parent interrupt your zoom. Recurrents are worth $47,000. You just don't know it yet. This could be good if it was true, right? It obviously took it from the original post which is assumed to be true. But I don't. I don't have anything to back up the $47,000 yet. I could take this as painting kind of a scenario or situation showing how. You know either a case study about how a client made more money, and you know, updated to the appropriate number. Another way is just like painting a picture of like, Hey, this is how like your zoom recordings have all this extra content. If you post more content, you're gonna probably get more clients, you know, like extrapolate your current. kpis Roi's from your content now and like, let's say, that holds. But you start producing 10 times the amount of content, you know, like you go route like routes like that. I like this one last Tuesday bit, analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot does it now? Right? That's kind of a nice fun. But therefore, type of thing, it's not a true but it does, however, have that kind of contrast there. It's like, oh, I create an automation content automation system. But I'm done creating content forever. Like, what? What do you mean? So I might excuse me, you know. Maybe something changed changing this or adding to it where it'd be like. Last Tuesday, after finishing my content automation system and having bit analyzed my coaching calls, found something that made me quit creating content forever. I don't know something like that. And that's something I'll come back to in just a second after we go through option. 3. The Contrarian tooth. I like this one a lot. This is very much more me and my style, and like how I like to talk and talk to people. Stop creating content seriously. Stop what your conversations do instead. So it gives some good stuff, right? And again, this is all based on my brand kit, and if I don't like this you know, I can add stuff to my brand kit to get to get closer. I want just like, if I was working with contractor Va employee agency each time that we go through and create new content, you know, like they're updating their files. And you're like, Okay, we like this. We don't like that like this. Don't like that. Do the same thing with AI. See, Brand align, we don't really well. don't really need to go through all this stuff. Kind of similar to the last one with the critiques. But you know, just start with impossible sign claim use. But therefore, Max, 3 sentences per sections your decorative language. Oh, these were funny challenge. Don't coddle. You're either automating or you're cosplaying as va like this actually made me laugh out loud the 1st time. I don't know if y'all find it funny. But I do. I'm trying to get AI to put a little more humor into it. Your competitors use system. You use hope, it's a little bit too, on the nose. Every manual post is a choice to stay small. That one's kind of funny, too. Like if you could work that in a little bit differently, I think that could could be a funny. A funny thing I feel like this would be. Hmm! You would almost like I could see this being fun as like a parody of like a bro marketing thing, you know, like. have a guy pretending to be like super Bro and buff, be like every manual post, is a choice to stay small. You know, kind of like one of those bodybuilder type things anyways. So this we're just gonna kind of like, totally skip over. It it my part of my direction. The brand kit is like. I like to keep things concise. Economy of words, you know. Don't use fluff stuff like that, and I should specify this out a bit more. because I don't want, you know, like is too short. Right? It's it's interpreting what I meant by concise incorrectly, and again, like as I was kind of looking through my brand kit, I'm not 100% sure where, how or what is causing it to do that in here ruthless edits probably would be part of it. Pragmatic. Yeah, I think you know some of those some of those might do it. But and also, too, like I didn't want a paragraph post right? It just didn't know from the 1st conversation over here where I asked for the long form specifically right. It's telling me here's a compelling long form, but this doesn't know that I wanted long form. It just knows I got a long form. So it's like, Oh, we should shorten this next steps. Here's some of the rewrites, I'm like, okay, sure fine, but that's not exactly it. And what I like to do. And this has been a complete game changer with whisper, whisper, flow, now is you just start the conversation right? So, you know, do the fn and spacebar. and go back through this prompt and just talk through what I like, what I don't like what I agree with, what I disagree with anything I want changed stuff like that. right? And look at this. Look at this context like this was just for me talking, you know, and imagine, like most people just like typing this out aren't going to type this much, just, you know, simply because, like it's take a while, takes a minute but instead, like, I can just talk through all this and just be like I like this part. I don't like that part. This is kind of what I'm going for. Blah blah blah! And then and then a little little hack little secret that I love to use and finish off a lot of my prompts with is. ask me any follow-up questions. Come on. ask me any. Follow up questions you need to in order to be 90% confident, you can make the necessary updates to really make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like this for them. So the important part is, ask me questions until you're 90% confident you can effect. Can dot dot right? don't go above 90 do like 80% if you want to. But like 80, 90% is good, anything above 90, it just gets like too detailed. So what you're basically saying here is like, what contacts are you missing that you need to create the post I want? And if you gave it like some decent input before and tell you like, what your goal is, what you're trying to do things like that. And we'll get more into this into like conversation structure in the next video. But what it's what we're doing here is asking like, what other details do you need to know what are the things you know about me. To make this really good. And you can simply say, like to effectively, you know, 90% confident to effectively help me create this or finish this task, finish this project whatever like. I like being a little bit more explicit in these things because it does help kind of guide the AI and like what to think about right? Like 90% confident you can make the necessary updates to make. And I should take really out of there. But who cares to make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like that for them? Right. The ultimate goal that I want is an effective Facebook post that will help people have people reaching out to me. Right? So what do you need to know to be 90% confident that you can do that. Create that Facebook post. And it will ask right? It's not going to groan. It's not going to be like, oh, my God! You want me to rewrite it again, or do this again. So it was great feedback. I need to figure out like, well, I don't know this kind of feels nice, but you know, these being a helpful assistant, they can be a bit sycophantic. And will usually tell you. That's good, right? Otherwise. So you do have to take a bit of critical thinking and make sure it's actually right and not just blowing smoke up your ass. It's really important to do like, I don't recommend using AI to create content around subjects that you aren't familiar with, because it will do a really really good job writing something that is complete, 100% bullshit, or just like off the mark of what's kind of like, accurate and true. It'll sound really good and like, if you don't know, like the industry like, yeah, that that totally makes sense. But then you hand it to the client. They're like the this isn't right. You're like fuck. So just make sure that, like you do know what you're talking about. Before you have AI do it so you can proofread in that And then what I did in the last video that I didn't record is essentially took whisper flow like I talked about before. started it, and just read through these and just kind of answered the questions right and talk through this. You mentioned your accomplishments, writing 10 million words, any specific client transformations, your own content, metrics. real systems, metrics. Right? We don't need to go into this at the moment. It's probably a little bit too in depth, on, like how I think about things. But what you can see and what is important to point out here is because I use whisper, flow. Look at these answers right? Like this is a lot of context that I'm giving it and able to give it super easily, because all I did was start it. And then, just, you know, like, read through and brain dumped. Yeah, I'm like, no, this isn't right. I'd like this to do this instead. Blah blah. So it gives all that. And I haven't actually read the updated version yet. So let's we'll go through that together and see what what we come up with. So here we go 1st off quick, naming suggestions so like one of the things I did want to use, because, like, I don't want to do sales calls initially, or frame them as sales calls and don't I excuse me. I want to instead do it as a like brand Kit design type call where we help build out like their brand kit design kit. and then a minute, prompt that people can use and try it out and create content for them, and then have the sales call kind of thing. So ask for some naming ideas. I don't like voice mining call, but I do like content. DNA session. That's kind of a good one. The mining like. I don't know how I could get content. DNA mining I don't know but content set DNA session sounds pretty good. We can run with that version. One wake up, call level 10 sas, alright. Let's see. Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too. Really, quickly is tone calibration. I would definitely say, like my true authentic energy, is the 10 full. Wake up. You're doing everything wrong. Type of thing. I can be very to the point. and blunt in that respect with a bit of disregard, for like social norms, social conventions. And you know it's 1 of those things where. when you're creating content, you know I know the the trope is like, be authentic, be authentic and like yes, absolutely. But like, how authentic do you need to be in that like. I have a whole life outside of, like what I do here, and what I post that I don't talk about just because it's a not relevant and be like, not things that like I want to talk about right? Is that like inauthentic? I'm not sharing my entire life. I don't know, maybe, but you don't need to know that stuff right there. There is a specific business purpose. That I am creating this content for like, yes, I am trying to help people. So I do want to make sure that, like it catches their attention in a way that makes them open to receiving my ideas rather than just like shove in your face. You're doing wrong right? So we'll see what this full wake up. You're doing everything wrong, energy is. And then the other one I asked for like something that's more in like the 5 to 6 range, like a little. It's balanced, but it's just like a little tip towards towards the Sas here. So I'm curious to see what it does in that respect. you know, and kind of how it compares right? And that comes back to like your own, like understanding your own personal, like biases, flaws, worldviews and things like that. It's like knowing the ways in which you think about, and present yourself to the world that might not be effective, helpful, or beneficial to your bigger goals, you know, whether, again, like could be creating. You know, some sort of dollar value that you're looking for. It could be an impact. It could be a freedom, you know. That's the thing, I think, is really awesome about AI is more and more. People will have the ability to create lifestyle businesses. Right? You know, we, I think we're going to see kind of an end to the make millions of dollars in 90 day. Yeah, we're we're already seeing a lot of that like make money online stuff fizzle out. But I think it's going to come back even more. To the point where you will see a lot more people, you know, making just average income online, creating content about specific topics or things that they're interested account interested. On different accounts. Right? So we'll see more of that in the future. And where's I going with that one? I don't know. But oh, the the business purpose right? So like. Let's see what level 10 sas gets us. And if that's a little bit too over the top. So version one. oh. yeah, we'll get into this. We'll get this. I'll come back to that second stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do it instead. Because right now you're cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running systems, and every manual post you create is a choice to stay small. harsh, good. Someone needs to say it. Last Tuesday bit analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot army handles it. Now. here's what bit discovered. You're performing the same conversation 5 times a week and creating 0 content from it. Meanwhile you're staring at Canva at 11 Pm. Trying to remember what font you used last time, Atlas, nearly short, circuited when he mapped out the ways. Think about it. Monday. Strategy session with a client gone. Tuesday group coaching masterclass, deleted Wednesday sales call where you drop your best framework banished. Thursday. Interview, where you explained your entire methodology. Poof! Friday workshop, where every set everyone said, mind blowing dust. 3 min of pure gold. 0 content cried. But you'll spend your weekend batching content. Aka! Panic cream, mediocre posts. I like that. You're either automating or you're larping as your own intern huh! Choose. I like that part a lot. I do like that. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice. Every zoom call you do contains 12 to 15 story loops. Android chaperone will weep with joy. 8 to 10 contrarian insights. Your audience needs 20 quotable moments that would stop scrolls 3 to 5. Complete teaching frameworks. Enough email sequences to nurture leads for month within 1 h of hitting end meeting bidden Atlas can extract all of it. Bitmaps, narrative structure, atlas, cuts, formats, and deploys. You go have lunch. But Francis AI. Content is garbage. You're right. Those write viral posts with AI tools, absolute trash. I've tested them all. They pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration porn that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune cookie. I like this a lot. I don't know if you all think this is funny, but I am. I'm a fan. that's not what this is. Here's what separates this from every other AI content scam. I spent 10 years running over 10 million words that generated 10 million dollars in revenue for clients, real campaigns, real business, real money. I know it converts. And what's just noise. So I build your custom prompts. They're not templates. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. I like this. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. We spend a session extracting your content. DNA. I build custom brand kits, design kits, and prompts your system, learns your frameworks, your language, your edge, then every one to 2 weeks we refine it together, because good enough is the enemy of extraordinary. The coaches who get this are already ahead. While you're finding your voice. They're everywhere. While you're planning content. They're closing deals while you're building consistency. They've already won. not because they're better coaches because they realize coaching calls are content. Creation, truth bomb. So this is like, well, all right. I'll come back to that. I so I want to read through all this before I start critiquing. It's really hard, though. Truth bomb. I built this system because I spent 4 years watching brilliant coaches fail, not because they couldn't coach, because they couldn't market, and I was tired of seeing mediocre coaches with great marketing eat their lunch. The world needs more good coaches, not more good marketers. So I built the bridge, upload your zoom, call, walk away, come back to 6 weeks of content, fair warning. I only take 10 clients per month. not fake scarcity, real bandwidth limits. Each client gets custom prompts personal refinement sessions, and my decade of experience baked into their system. That takes time. I refuse to dilute the quality. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out. We do a content. DNA session, not a sales call. I build your custom system during our call. You watch your own words become 30 pieces of content. You decide. If you want this power permanently. the session alone will change. How you think about content forever. You have 2 choices. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep falling behind. Keep watching others dominate your space. or let your conversations become your content. Empire DM me with, done with manual right now I'll send you examples of what bidden Atlas created from a single 37 min call your next zoom call is either tomorrow's content or tomorrow's regret. You decide Francis Ps. Still manually creating content in 2024. That's like handwriting, hand washing clothes when you own a washing machine, except the washing machine, also folds organized and delivers everything to your closet while you sleep. Alright. Alright! Alright! You know, as far as the Sas goes, and don't think that was too over the top, like. I don't think anything in there was really going to like turn someone off or piss them off. so I'm not sure how I feel about that. We'll see what version? 2 firm but fair level 5 to 6 sounds like. And then once I'm done reading this. We'll go back and talk about how I'd kind of critique and edit from here, because, like, I don't, these are not production ready yet. And and we want to get through these. And because right now, what I'm trying to do is show you that AI can write some pretty good content like this. It's still going to always sound a little bit off, because, like it's not quite your own words. But, as you can see. I'm putting a lot of my own stuff in here. And as I've been kind of like talking through this I've told them, like little bits about me and that's where it knows, what I say, oh, I talked about this. In there. Well, actually, I said, those vite I, mentioned the the right viral posts, like social media scheduling tools. This they came out with this on its own like that was pretty good stuff. But this is definitely much more in line in line with me although not quite there yet. Version 2 firm but fair level 5 and 6. Stop creating content. Wait, hear me out, let your conversations do instead. Last week bit analyzed my coaching calls, and discovered something that completely changed. How I think about content. Bit bit's my AI co-pilot. Atlas is the one who does the heavy lifting they're about to become your favorite team. Here's what we found. The average coach is 5 to 10 conversations per week that could become 200 plus pieces of content. Instead, those conversations disappear into the zoom cloud while you stress about what to post tomorrow. Sound familiar. I get it. I really do. For 10 years I've been the behind the scenes writer creating content systems for coaches, 10 million words written 10 million plus in revenue generated and hundreds of campaigns launched. and you know what killed me. watching brilliant coaches struggle with content while mediocre ones dominate the space, the difference systems. Here's the uncomfortable truth. your best content already exists. It's in your coaching, calls, your strategy sessions, your masterclasses, your workshops. Every single conversation contains complete story arcs that would make Andre chaperone, proud, quotable insights. Your audience desperately needs teaching frameworks. You don't even realize you're sharing email sequences, hiding your explanations. Social posts scattered throughout your sentences within 1 h of ending your zoom call. All this could be extracted, formatted, and ready to post. But AI content sucks. You're absolutely right, those generic right viral post tools. They're why, everyone sounds the same. It's exactly why I built something different. And here's how this actually works. Instead of templates, you get custom prompts built specifically for your voice. You start with a content DNA session, where I learn your unique frameworks, your communication style, your brand personality, your audience's languages. Then build custom, brand kits, design kits and prompts. Capture your essence, not generic. AI, slop your actual voice, automate, and here's the kicker every one to 2 weeks. We were fine together, and I know, like, I'm really not liking this very much. But I'm reading this all the way through for 2 reasons. One, it's super important to read your copy out loud, to hear how it sounds, but also to like there might be like one or 2 nuggets in here that I really like that I can use. Right? I I like this part. you know, this is, this is decent, like, we can do something with this. But like, for the most part, I'm just not. Yeah. I like the 10 better. Not generic. AI slop. Your actual voice automated. Here's the kicker everyone fine together because your voice evolves, your message sharpens your system. Should, too. This one. This is good math is simple. We did that. Why I built this. I spent years managing content teams for coaches. I hate it managing people, coordinating schedules, chasing deadlines. It was everything I didn't want to do. I just wanted to create great content. That converts. I built a system that came up. Excuse me. So I built a system that could handle 89% of the heavy lifting. Now, one person can manage what used to take a team and coaches can focus on coaching instead of content. Creation. Here's the thing. The coaches succeeding right now are better than you. They just show up more consistently while you're playing content. They're posting content while you're finding your voice. They're amplifying theirs while you're learning canva. They're closing clients. The gap isn't talent. It's systems. I can only take 10 new clients this month. This isn't fake scarcity. It's real bandwidth. Each client gets custom prompt, developed, personal onboarding, bi-weekly refinement sessions by decade of experience. Quality takes time or is refuse to compromise on that what happens next? You reach out with ready for systems. We schedule a content DNA system. I build your custom system during the call, no pressure sales zeros, right? So I'm just gonna skip the rest of that because kind of yeah, I just I like, I like the Sas version better for sure but still not quite there yet. So we're just going to go from here right? So like this part. I feel it's less funny than when I read it the 1st time. I think that's because it's trying to jam it together. So like the 1st thing I'm gonna do is copy this. I don't really like that section as much as I did in your rubric or grading. I feel like it kind of falls a little bit flat when you scrunch it all together. I think having something earlier on about cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running system. Well, I don't like the competitors. Running systems part. The cosplaying Va is really good. And then, later on, you had something about oh. the intern thing, and I forgot where it was. But, like I I like that, I think, combining those together early on could be a nice little comedic relief and humorous bit to get into the content right away and pull people in. So what if we drop the every manual post you create as a choice to say small and like. Try to use that somewhere later in the post and focus this once, like on the cause playing with like the Va intern stuff, because I think that could be a lot funnier. Oh, oh. shoot so I didn't have like the text box. Oh, it's control command. B. There we go alright. And then so this is all I'm gonna do. As I go through here is just say like what I like and don't, and how I want to finish it. I'm not gonna pause and actually go through this like and talk you guys so you can hear how I like go through this and think about this rather than just do, and then be like, Oh, here, here's the output. Because that's not helpful. I'm not really liking the integration of bit and atlas into this right it it seems a bit jarring and confusing of like, Who's this bit person analyzing the coaching calls? And who's this Atlas person structuring together? So I think maybe we should just drop that all together for this and just not use the characters at all. What else I do like the stern at Canva 11 pm. Reference. That's pretty solid. I also really like the think about it. Section the Monday, Tuesday, fri. Through Friday, like those those really good I think we should keep those and then oh, here we there's the larping as your own intern. I think that's really good to alright. I didn't mean to say that in there I just got excited when I found it all right. Should keep those The. Here's what's actually insane. Part is pretty solid, too. We can keep that again like dropping the bitten Atlas can extract all that I think it would be beneficial to just say something along the lines of as soon as your zoom call is done processing you know we leverage AI and automations to analyze the transcript for the best moments, using code. Something like that, you know. We turn that long form into clips right away and then iterate over each clip to create. I don't know. Post something like that. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for there, but I do like the idea of like the the AI, you know, bit. Does this Atlas does that? You go have lunch? But again dropping like bit and atlas, and just having some sort of like AI is doing this thing while you're off living your life and right. And that's 1 thing that I really kind of like want to touch on what I think is so exciting about AI, and everybody is like freaked out like AI is gonna take our jobs like, yes, good, please, please, like I don't. The more AI can do this. The more that I can like help. Other people like create better content for themselves right? Because, like writing good content. like, actually, right as a human like takes time, takes energy, lots of brain power and stuff like that. And it's also difficult, because, like, I don't actually know what my clients thinking, like, all I can go on is the conversations I've had and the things that they've shared with me, and I might have not asked the right questions like I do a pretty good job, and I try my best and things like that. But I don't always ask the right things. But if it's you writing the content for yourself, having a conversation with an AI, you know that that thing will spark or like. It'll ask a question like, Oh, that story right? Which might might not have been a story that you even thought about before. So there's a lot of benefits to being able to like. Do all this more yourself. And the AI is making that happen right like, especially in the copywriting. Field content creation field. It's taking those jobs. And it's going to keep taking people's jobs. And it's going to be starting with like those mundane move, data from one software to another. this, that and the other thing copy paste kind of stuff like a lot of Admin tasks. Things like that are going to be eaten up really quickly. and we're going to be freed up to do like cooler, better things, right like, instead of thinking like, Oh, my God, you know, executive assistant like you're gonna fire them because of AI. It's like, no like they're going to. Now have an AI tool that has all of your conversations that you've been having with clients, them team, whatever that they can infinitely query to help them come up with plans, ideas, executions for the stuff that you want to happen right? So it's going to give them more power to do their job faster and better like. That's what we're getting into. So back to it. Ai content is garbage right? Those red error. I really like the pull on. I really like the viral post tool section that's really good. I think. kind of putting ourselves against those works really well, because there are like dozens of right viral content software out there. But the they pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration poem that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune. Cookie is absolutely fire. I love that I like and want to have more lines like that throughout the content. Let's see. Alright. So let's see this next part here. Oh. so I like this start of the here's what separates this from every other. AI content scam section. But what I do want to kind of get into a little bit more of like what it is, what they're getting kind of thing, because it's not quite accurate right now. What? Oh, what? So what this is more about is like, we're gonna have the content DNA call. And that's designed to get the custom brand Kit design Kit. And then Meta prompt so they can create their own content. But that's more of like a free lead magnet kind of thing, like a way to give value 1st and like show proof, this works. We're not building their system or anything on the call. They're not getting anything like done on the caller like that point of this is to get them the prompts that they can use and start putting it like chat to your cloud right now and create content, but also to like. I am going to give them some clips and some example posts created by the system, just to show them like what's possible. Using this system. And you know, I do like the the one part of like you get to decide if this is something you want permanently, right? So like, basically, what we're gonna be doing is going over their business, who they are, what they're doing, what their offer is stuff like that to build out the brand and design Kit, I'm going to turn that call into a few clips for them for examples, and then go over that with them, and then, at the very least. They're going to have the brand Kit design Kit and the Meta prompt that they can use with just like a regular chat Gpt or Claude session and make whatever kind of content that they want manually that way. And it's just something. If they want help with the automation part of it, then we can talk about using my system. Let's see anything else. I really do like the section under the coaches who get ahead. Get this already ahead, like while you're finding your voice while you're playing content while you're building consistency. I like those. those are really solid. I do want you to drop the thing like truth. Bomb fair warning. That's a little bit like, too, on the nose for me. I'm much bigger fan of the 2 plus 2, and let them figure out it's 4 method, right? that's where it goes in the show and not tell like no one likes being told. But we do want to tell them and give them kind of the right ingredients for them to come to the conclusion that we want type of thing. Oh, my God! Need to remember to keep that on there. Okay, what else? Oh. I don't want to mention anything about like come back to 6 weeks of content like, I don't want to put the week thing in there, simply because, like a who are we to decide like how much content someone posts. And then the other thing, too, is like depending on how we set up these prompts. It might only be a day or 2 days, or a couple days worth of content. It just might be that we have custom stuff for each platform, like really kind of depends on the client and how much content they want to put out. Like, for example, I plan to do long form videos, multiple times a week and create a bunch of clips and content from that. And you know, ideally, you know, post a ton of clips from each of those where, like one of those videos might be like 2 or 3 days worth of content, only type of thing. So I don't want to say 6 weeks worth of content, because then that also seems like overwhelming. It's like, oh, well, then, what do I? What do I need this for? Like I'm just gonna like, fill up with so much content, so quickly like, so again, this is more for giving them like a bunch of content. That they can put out everywhere and just make sure that they're getting exposure, because, like the one thing that we can know for certain is that if you put out more content, more people are going to see your content right if if every video you get gets 200 views and you put out one video a day, that's 200 views. But if you put out 5 videos a day that now becomes a thousand views right? And you can easily just start to multiply the views you get by putting out more content. Even if you're not necessarily growing right away, because there is like a certain amount of consistency and timing that you need to like. put on these platforms to build up an audience didn't mean to send in that last part. That was kind of just the conversation to that's supposed to be for us, but we'll see what we'll see what it does with that. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out here 2 choices. I'm not too happy with the ending with, like the 2 choices. Type of thing. It it falls a little flat. 1st off like I'm not. Gonna send them a example of another call like that seems pointless like when we're gonna do like a call together. And they're gonna have like specific content for them. Right? Like, why would I want to see a generic example of someone else. When I can get one. That's for me. Right? So let's drop that part. Also, it's 2025, not 2024. I like the the hand washing clothes, analogy type thing. And then how you also do like folds, organizes, delivers. Could we find a different but similar analogy that might be like a little bit more ridiculous and funny. So we end it kind of on like a fun. Humorous note. You know just anything that just kind of makes a little bit more like ridiculous and extreme pretzels. Oh. alright! We'll see what we get there. And then last thing. and to be clear, these were all suggestions and edits for the level. 10 Sas. Post. I like that a lot better than the level 5 to 6 1. i thought the 5 to 6 1 was actually just like pretty flat and overall. Just not very inspiring up in that. Sas is definitely better. I was actually impressed or not impressed. I was surprised that it wasn't more sas, I guess, but worked out pretty well. I think we could like up up the Sas just a hair with a few more of those funny one-liners like I mentioned, but overall very good with that. and I would say, just like, Let's drop the second one and just kind of fell flat like I said, I don't think we need to really like. Do anything more with it. we'll just drop it for now and work on the 1st post. All right. Didn't mean to hit. Enter. Yeah, I want to put one more thing. Let's stop that minutes. It's so before I start speaking with the intro here. I do always like giving some kind of like starting with either encouragement, reinforcement, or kind of critiques right away, just to like. Let the AI know like where I stand on the content. You know I might say like this is not anything that I was looking for. I don't like any of this blah blah, or I might say like, Oh, my God, this is great, this fantastic start! Here's some edits I want to make stuff like that. I think that just does a good job like helping to prime the AI and knowing like is this, you know, like. is this going in a minor edits way, or like we go and rewrite right like there, there is something, and we'll get into that more. But there is like something about like activating different parts of their memory. This is a really good start. I like a lot of the edits and updates that we made. So far, I think we have just a little bit more to go. And I've put my suggestions, notes, ideas below here. I need you to analyze those and then rewrite and update the 1st version. Make it more in line with what I'm talking about, and just generally better. I really need to like find a better way to say like, Make it better, because, like. what does better mean? Right? So maybe actually, what we'll do. let's see, make it more aligned with my talk about, and at least 10% better. Then the current version and try that. And then we always want to go back down to the end and just do kind of a quick context, synopsis summary, and like one more time, like what we want to after analyzing your post above and all the additional contacts I've given you, I need you to rewrite the Facebook post. So it's more in line with what I said above. I want it to be a little bit funnier, too, and then also just ensure that it's 10% better and more interesting engaging for our coaching audience. Alright, let's see what happens there. And as it's chat as it's thinking and doing its thing. you know, I gotta wrap this up here because I've got another call. I have to run off to. But I think this is a great start with kind of showing like what you can do. both with just like the difference of how. And I think the main thing that like I want to show is like the difference between just like throwing in a prompt here and seeing what you get versus having one of these projects with a prompt already built into it. And mind you like, what we'll be doing in the next video is actually going over the brand kit and probably this specific prompt and refine it more right? Because it's like. well, let's see what. Let's see what happens. Let's see what we got with this rewritten version. Maximum. Wake up energy. Let me get hydrated first.st Stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do instead, because right now your cosplay is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that make content in their sleep. Yes, Karen, from your mastermind, the one who suddenly posts everywhere. She's not working hard. She just stopped playing intern. Last Tuesday I analyzed my coaching call recordings and discovered something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the robots handle it. Now. here's what I found. You're performing the same brilliant conversation 5 times a week, creating exactly 0 content from it. Then staring at canva at 11 pm. Trying to remember if you used Montserrat or railway last time. This is insane behavior. Think about Monday strategy session, where you drop pure gold. Tuesday group coaching masterclass everyone loved vanished. Wednesday. Sales. Call where you explain your entire methodology. Gone. Thursday workshop, where 3 people cried from breakthroughs, poof! Friday. Interview where you finally nailed your origin. Story, dust, 300 min of certified genius, 0 content created but sure spend money. Saturday bashing, content, translation, panic, Korean mediocre post where your coffee gets cold and your family wonders if you still live there. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice every single zoom call contains 12 to 15. Complete story arcs. The kind Andre chaperone charges 10 KA month to map out. I forgot to take this out like no one cares like if anybody even knows who's Andre Chaperon is like, I'd be surprised like he's very much more of a lifestyle business guy. But he's absolutely one of my favorite marking writers. So like. yeah, I forgot to mention that you know what we're just gonna go back and do that really quick. See, this is where I talk about like I will go back and redo this when I don't like something, or if I forgot something, and it really here, we'll put it here, because that's right around the same spot. Don't mention Andre chaperone, or really like any of the creators in my brand kit. Those aren't something to be explicitly referenced or said publicly. I gave those in the brand kit so that you have a better understanding of who I like to create content like or other creators that, like I enjoy their content, think they're good writers, things like that, and would be excited if someone thought my content was similar to theirs. So it's more so a design style thing, than anything that you should ever, ever, ever mention their name like I never want to see like their names come up unless it's something that like I've explicitly referenced that you're transforming, but never introduce their name on your own. Okay. alright. So we'll drop that back in there and give it a second to rewrite and again, like, that's, I think, a really important thing, too, is like, if you see some of those little errors as you go go back and redo this. It's gonna save you a lot as far as like context and conversations goes, because, like Claude has a limit. Chatgp doesn't really anymore. Now that it has the memory feature built in like. I haven't reached a conversation limit, but there are very real conversational limits with Claude now. So if you kind of go back and tweak this a bit. It also gives you a better starting spot right like from here. I would probably go back and keep redoing this and keep editing this until I get closer to what I wanted to the point of even like, maybe I would take this section out, or I'd re explain that section. So let's see what it said. Now stop creating content seriously. Stop, let your conversations do instead, because right now your cosplan is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that work while you sleep. Yes, you, the one who just opened canva in another tab. Close it. Here's what I discovered last Tuesday. So, you know, I'm still not super happy with this opening, and I don't think we're going to quite get there in this session, and that's what we're going to. I guess this is what I'll kind of leave you off with, and a little tease here is like the next thing that we're going to do in the next video is, I'm going to redo my brand kit. And I think we'll actually work on a structured prompts right? Like I have have this social post, right? We should probably have. Actually, you know, I'm gonna do this really quick. No, I'm not because I don't necessarily like this like this is just kind of like a placeholder to to get stuff going. So what will come back in this next video is restructuring this prompt and then kind of going back through the same similar exercise and showing like how to do it like. Quote unquote the right way, right like I. I would put this like the good wrong way, like, if you don't have your own Meta prompts create or structured prompts created where you can kind of consistently put. create content, a certain output. This would be the way that you really should be having a conversation with the ais like you start with something right. You have to give it some sort of draft piece finished piece, whatever it might be, the better that you can give it in the beginning. the better. The conversation is gonna go. But, like, you know, if you don't have a lot of marketing or copyright experience like that's fine, right, give it something and then work with it from there to improve it. And you know you can start with just saying like, Hey, first, st I need to create a rubric to make this better oops. and then from there it'll give you a bunch of ideas and things like that. If you need more suggestions, ask for more suggestions. You just go back and have this back and forth conversation until you get the way you want. And is there a pain? Kind of yeah. But what I'll show you in the next video is like how you can either a take that like a, you know, like we originally did in this one right? And it creates a prompt for it for this rubric, and you can go back in and then refine the prompt to be like exactly what you're looking for and then work with it from there, and kind of restart the conversation type of thing right? Because, like, if I went, I took this prompt actually, let's see what happens when I do take this prompt alright. Let's just see while I kind of blab on a little bit. So now this is actually taking that rubric that we gave, and it's going to edit it based on that right. And I'll probably come up with something like even better than what we had before, and you just kind of keep working out from there. And then, once you have that prompt d plus it got it went up a little bit interesting. But once you have that kind of base prompt, you can start to work with it and use it, and that's what we'll be doing in the next video is, I will actually be kind of going through of like creating a very structured prompt with, Hey, how to create a good lead, how to create a good hook, what goes in the body, and like more and more and more details about that. So I'm not having this kind of like back and forth where? You know, to be perfectly honest like that last those last couple of versions that it's not done. Those last couple versions that we saw. I'm like these are better. But again, like the hook lead is still just not quite there. So that's something that we can work on and fix with a really good, detailed, prompt. And that's what I'm going to be covering the next video here and now, just to end this out like, let's just take a look at what the difference is with putting in that much more explicit, prompt about with, like the actual rubric in there, generic opening 0 pattern interrupt right? Like. So it's saying a lot of similar things, you know, obviously, that we would think but is getting more insight into why, it's yes or no right complete voice mismatch. This reads like every Guru sales page, not pragmatic text, heavy blah, blah 0 brand characters where it's Atlas, where it's bit right? So like it's pretty similar to like what we've gone through already. But it gives more context, which would be super super helpful if you are someone who's newer to marketing, and you're just not entirely sure like why, this would be like good or bad. That opening is deader than Disco. The fake empathy is nauseating. You buried your actual differentiator. Your brand has 10 years experience, see? See? So like, that's that's a really interesting point that like hasn't been brought up yet. that it's saying that the actual differentiator is that experience. And like, where is any of that you know credibility. We get the trust me, Bro. Energy, right? So like this would be like, Hey, like, let's just make sure that we get that like higher up. You know, if you follow Alex from Osel with the proof promise plan, you know, starting out with a proof like 10 years experience 10 million dollars. 10 million words that kind of thing. let's see what it says for new. See? Like, look, look we didn't get this hook before, after writing 10 million words and building 500 plus automation flows. I've discovered the 7 min prompt chain that turns any zoom call into 30 pieces of content. So like it's not quite what I would use, just simply because, like, it's not totally accurate. But this much better hook than the last one. Right. I like it more than the stop creating content, and whatever else character driven story Atlas here last Tuesday had been analyzed. No right like we. Just my character's wrong. So we're just gonna have to drop the character stuff. Contrarian challenge. Your content. Strategy is backwards. Stop creating. Start capturing. Here's the na and M. Workflow that changed everything. Right? So if I want to go more of a technical route, maybe if I was going after like automation people and saying like, Hey, like I have a like a done for you, product that like you can sell and use and modify yourself like I might go that angle with that you know. But again the the, the prompt itself. kind of lacks a bit of understand like who my actual audience is, and simply because I just haven't updated updated with like, who I'm going after. Now, I've been kind of in a audience finding as I built this out. driving gold, sharing insights. I like that. I like that right? So like overall like I'm I'm enjoying these suggestions much better. And a cta that doesn't suck instead of drop a try. Curious how bit analyzes your calls. Watch them, dissect a real coaching session, extract 31 content pieces in 7 min. Link and comments. No email required like, I like this call to action a lot better again, if we just drop the character part of it. You know the linking comments. No email required. Basically, it's just saying, like, Hey, like, you want to see a demo of the system like you'll be able to watch. Send a comment. Just watch it. You don't have to do it. So right, this kind of inspires me of like, okay, like, maybe that's something I'll need to do as part of some of these posts is like, have that kind of follow on piece, and whether it's I don't know. Maybe it's just post, you know, like posting the full video like this to Youtube in the comments. So like, Hey, if you want to go deeper, check it out. So yeah, I'm gonna cut this here. I'm pretty sure we've gone on for longer than I thought. But I'm pretty pretty happy with how this how what we've gone through so far. And then I think the next thing that we'll do tomorrow is actually start to Start with the brand kit and the design Kit, I think it's really important to go into those. There's a few things I've learned since then that I'd like to Update and create like, I said, like I created these as like the minimum viable, prompt that I can have for all this stuff to like. Just get something that's generally correct like I said, like, I don't necessarily like a lot of this, but it was more for proof of concept, for the system to get something out there. And now what I'm going to be doing over the next few days is refining all this stuff and really putting some more thought and effort into it and getting getting this really down to the point where it's actually creating like content that I really really like. Because I know AI can do it. I've done it. I produced it. you know. A lot of it's just like in here, with some more back and forth, but with what I've really been learning the last couple months. I know that we can do this in the single shot with it here. So stay tuned for the next video where we're going to actually be diving into how to update and change some of these prompts so that they create better content and help AI create content that doesn't suck. Thanks for watching if you made it. This far, really enjoyed talking about this stuff and can't wait to talk more about it.\n\n{/Transcript}\n"

          "designkit": "🎨 Design Kit V3 - The Craftsman's Systems (November 2025)\nTheme: Hand-crafted tech wisdom meets workshop ingenuity. Visual systems that make complex AI workflows feel as approachable as sketching on a napkin, as precise as Japanese joinery, and as rewarding as harvesting from your own garden.\n\nA. Visual Theme\nCore Mood\nWarm workshop wisdom meets digital precision. Every visual should feel like it was sketched by someone who genuinely loves both building things with their hands AND solving problems with technology. The aesthetic bridges the gap between a master craftsman's workshop notebook and a modern system architect's blueprint - never choosing one over the other, but finding beauty in their intersection.\nSetting Variants\n1. Morning Workshop A sun-drenched workbench made of worn maple, with wood shavings catching golden hour light. Graph paper spreads across the surface with hand-drawn system diagrams. Japanese hand saws and chisels rest in their designated spots on the pegboard behind. A cup of coffee steams next to an open notebook. The scene feels lived-in, productive, and optimistic - this is where ideas become reality.\n2. Digital Whiteboard An infinite clean canvas that still maintains the warmth of hand-drawn elements. Grid dots fade into the background like graph paper. Nodes and connections appear hand-sketched with slight imperfections that make them human. Colors are warm and inviting despite being digital. Annotations appear in handwritten style. The space breathes with generous negative space.\n3. Garden Planning (Overhead) Bird's eye view of a garden plot with different sections in various stages of growth. Pathways wind between raised beds like data flowing through systems. Some areas show fresh soil (preparation), others have seedlings (early growth), mature plants (established systems), and harvest baskets (outputs). Sketched labels on wooden stakes mark each section. The garden expands organically but with clear intentional design.\nTexture Mix Philosophy\nTextures should layer like memories - the digital precision of our present tools overlaid with the tactile warmth of traditional craftsmanship. A blueprint might show through graph paper. Wood grain might peek through a flowchart. These aren't random - they remind us that all technology serves human purposes.\nContrast Modes\nOld Way Aesthetic: Cramped, cluttered compositions in grayscale with harsh shadows. Tangled lines create anxiety. Clock faces loom oppressively. Figures appear stressed, hunched over computers. The palette is cold grays and warning reds. Everything feels urgent yet stuck.\nNew Way Aesthetic: Open, breathing compositions with warm sunset tones. Flowing connections create harmony. Time moves backward into freedom. Figures stand upright, gesturing at systems that work for them. The palette is warm oranges, growth greens, and calming creams. Everything feels intentional and sustainable.\n\nB. Color Palette\nRule: Maintain warm undertones even in technical diagrams. High contrast for accessibility.\n\nC. Typography Buckets\n\nD. Core Characters (Visual Spec)\nPip - The Process Assistant\nZen - The Wisdom Module\nBits - The Data Swarm\n\nE. Image Style Matrix\nTexture Overlays (combine with any base)\nPaper Grain Subtle fiber texture like quality sketch paper. Slightly off-white with visible paper tooth. Shadows pool slightly in the texture. Gives everything a tactile, physical quality.\nWood Grain\u000b Maple or birch grain running horizontally. Warm honey tones with natural variations. Suggests craftsmanship and careful construction. Never overpowering, always supporting.\nGrid Dots Light gray dots in perfect grid, like dot-grid notebooks. Helps organize space without being restrictive. Dots fade at edges. Creates subtle structure.\nWatercolor Wash Soft color bleeds with visible brush strokes. Edges are slightly unpredictable. Colors pool and blend naturally. Adds organic warmth to technical drawings.\nClean Vectors Perfectly smooth lines with no texture. Crisp edges and pure colors. Modern and precise but never cold. Best for final, polished presentations.\nMood Lighting Options\nMorning Workshop\nLight: Warm golden from top-left (sunrise through window)\nShadows: Soft, blue-tinted, extending bottom-right\nAtmosphere: Optimistic, fresh start, coffee steam visible\nColor temp: 3000K warm\nLate Night Building\nLight: Cool blue monitor glow from front, warm desk lamp from side\nShadows: Deep but not harsh, purple-tinted\nAtmosphere: Focused intensity, quiet determination\nColor temp: Mixed 6500K (screen) + 2700K (lamp)\nAfternoon Teaching\nLight: Neutral daylight from above, evenly distributed\nShadows: Minimal, just enough for depth\nAtmosphere: Clear, educational, approachable\nColor temp: 5000K neutral\nDiscovery Moment\nLight: Dramatic spotlight on key element\nShadows: High contrast, theatrical\nAtmosphere: \"Eureka!\" feeling, breakthrough energy\nColor temp: 4000K with color accent on focal point\n\nF. Node System Specifications\nAnimation States: pulse_ready → flow_active → glow_complete\n\nG. Visual Metaphor Library\n\nH. Composition Rules\n\nI.

Positive & Negative Brand Associations\nPositive: Relief • Possibility • \"I can actually do this\" • Time freedom • Creative control • Community support\nNegative: Overwhelm • \"Too technical\" • Hype culture • Grind mindset • Corporate automation • Lonely solopreneur life\n12. Audience Skepticism → Responses\n\"AI content is soulless\" → I get it—most AI content reads like a robot's fever dream. But here's the thing: we're not using AI to replace your voice, we're feeding it YOUR actual words from YOUR conversations. The AI becomes a sophisticated transcription and reorganization tool that maintains your personality, your stories, your unique perspective. It's like having an editor who knows your voice so well they can help you say what you mean better than you could alone.\n\"I'm not technical\" → Perfect, neither am I—I'm a marketer who learned just enough to be dangerous. If you can write an email or send a text, you already have all the technical skills you need. We're not coding; we're having conversations with AI using normal language. The whole point is to skip the technical stuff and get straight to results. Most of my community members go from zero to creating their first AI-assisted content in under an hour.\n\"This is just another course\" → Courses teach theory; we're building actual systems that work today. Join the free community first—no credit card, no sales funnel, just real people figuring this out together. Show up to a few office hours calls, try the prompts, see if this approach clicks for you. The beta program is only for people who've already gotten value from the free stuff and want to go deeper. If it feels like just another course, you're in the wrong place.\n\"AI will take my job\" → AI will definitely take parts of your job—the parts that suck. The data entry, the reformatting, the \"can you make 10 versions of this\" requests. But it can't replace human connection, creative problem-solving, or the ability to understand what someone really needs (not just what they asked for). We're using AI to eliminate the boring 80% so you can spend more time on the valuable 20% that actually requires a human brain and heart.\n\"I don't have time to learn this\" → You don't have time NOT to learn this. Ten minutes learning one good prompt today saves you 10 hours next week—I'm literally proving this daily. Start with one prompt for one specific task that's eating your time. Use it for a week. Once you feel that first \"holy shit, that used to take me an hour\" moment, you'll find the time. We're not asking you to become an AI expert; we're showing you how to solve today's problem today.\n\"Why not just hire someone?\" → Because then you're managing people instead of living your life. Employees need training, oversight, feedback, and paychecks. Freelancers need briefs, revisions, and constant communication. This system needs a few hours of setup then runs itself. Plus, when you hire out your content, you lose your voice—it becomes what someone thinks you should sound like, not what you actually sound like. Keep the control, lose the overhead.\n\"Sounds too good to be true\" → It would be if we were promising overnight success or viral content. We're not. This takes upfront work—building your brand kit, training your prompts, refining your system. The first month is investment; months 2-12 are returns. The difference is you're building an asset that compounds, not renting someone else's template. Check the community to see real people's actual results, not just my cherry-picked wins.\n13.

That doesn't suck? That is the question of the day. My name is Francis Waldeker. I've generated over 10 million dollars in revenue for online coaches over the last 10 years, written over 10 million words of content for clients in that time frame to done a bunch of other stuff. But a lot of what I've been doing lately. The last 4 years is really diving deep into AI last 2 years. Everything that I've been paid for to write for clients has been produced by AI, and I've never gotten more compliments. So I would say, yes, yes, AI can write content. That doesn't suck. but it can't read your mind. And I think that's really the core of what a lot of people misunderstand about AI. They think because it's so intelligent and knows all these things right, like AI is at Phd level intelligence right now, like researchers, medical doctors like they're using this to discover like new things about science. It's not coming up with new stuff yet, but I mean, it's super super smart. So it can write content. It absolutely can. But just because it's really smart doesn't mean it can read your mind. We're gonna scroll up here. Here's a little bit of structure. We're gonna try to see what we get through today with these. But this, I think, will turn into a multi-part series here. And what I'm going to actually be doing is going through, really, how I create prompts, how I think about prompting context engineering things like that. I really like to prefer just client conversation structure. Right. I know that the tech people are going to be all mad at me and stuff like that, and prompted sharing. But we're just talking AI here right. AI is built very, very much like humans. And how we think it's just, it's trained on the Internet, right? So there is a lot of how we think. and how humans think already baked into AI, and those things that you think are like weird about AI like hallucinations. One of my favorite things, everybody's like, Oh, AI hallucinates. So do people right? Like a hallucination is just something that's made up. And what is creativity at its core is making stuff up right. And then also, too, like humans will make stuff up all the time if they like. Don't know the answer, and don't want to seem stupid, so they'll constantly say whatever they can think of. That might sound smart, right whatever. So AI works a lot like humans. And and when you think of it like that. It makes it a lot easier to work with instead of treating it like this all-knowing thing that you can just be like, Hey, create a you know Facebook post for me. Right? We'll get into this a little bit more in a minute. Here we go. right. So this is Claude. This is a new 4.1 opus model that just dropped. You can use any model. It really doesn't matter. At this point I'll get more of that. But it's largely preference. But I go write me a viral Facebook post for online coaches that would get them to want to use my content automation system that automatically takes Zoom calls, turn them into clips and turns those clips in different pieces of written and image asset content. Put me together a long form Facebook post that will attract new clients and have them reaching out to me. Word to the wise. Make sure you hit record. Before starting this I record about an hour and a half of me going through all of this and totally forgot to hit record. So we're coming back through and basically going to walk through what I did with a lot of this stuff and kind of pick up where we left off here. So hopefully, we'll shorten things down. Probably not shorten things. But you're gonna get a lot more out of it than I did the 1st time around. So that's a prompt right? That's a the beginning of a conversation with AI. And this is a great example of expecting AI to read my mind right? I want long form Facebook posts that will attract new clients and have them reach out to me. I mean, that sounds fairly specific, right? Like. you might be able to say this to a very experienced marketer copywriter, and they could go and turn out some good content for you from here, but more than likely not because they don't, you know, if they don't know a lot about you, that's that's really it like, why AI writes bad content. it's because a lack of understanding about you, right? You know you're not probably Hubspot or Alex her Mosey, or you know some giant creator out there where there's tons and tons and tons of knowledge about you that the AI can just go and grab. You have to give it all that, because here. when you don't this is the kind of stuff you get. I just watched a coach spend 4 h turning one zoom call into social media content, and I wanted to scream. Here's what they did, rewatched the entire 6 min recording manually wrote down Timestamps for the good parts edited. 3 clips took forever, wrote captions from scratch created, quote cards in canva, posted everything manually manually. Total time, 4 plus hours for maybe 5 pieces of content. Meanwhile I'm over here turning my zoom calls into 30 plus pieces of content in under 10 min, not because I'm some content genius, but because I finally built a system I wish existed when I was grinding 16 h days. Here's the truth most Gurus won't tell you. Your best content is already happening every single day. It's in your coaching calls. It's in your group sessions. It's in your masterminds. You're literally dropping gold in your Zoom Rooms, then letting it disappear into the cloud, while you're stressing about what? To post tomorrow? Quick question. What if every time you hit end meeting on zoom, you automatically got 10 to 15 video clips, edit caption rate of post quote cards with the best one, liars, full transcripts turned into blog posts, email sequences from your teaching points, Linkedin articles from your frameworks, Instagram carousels from your key concept. tweet threads from your golden nuggets without lifting a finger without hiring a Va without learning complicated software. This is in theory. Last week, 1 45 min strategy session I did became 12 Instagram reels, 8 Linkedin posts, 3 blog articles, 15. Quote cards, one email sequence content, scheduled for 3 weeks from one call, the same call. I was doing anyways. Look, I get it. You became a coach to coach, not to become a content factory. But here's what we both know. No content equals, no visibility, no visibility equals no clients, no clients, equals no impact. And you didn't build this business to be the world's best kept secret. The coaches crushing it right now. They're not smarter than you. They're not better coaches than you. They just show up everywhere because they have systems that multiply their message while they sleep. Here's what I believe your expertise deserves to be heard. Your message needs to reach people waiting for it. Your impact shouldn't be limited by how many hours you can spend on camera Canada. So I built something that handles all of it. Upload your Zoom recording. Walk away, come back to a month's worth of content, fair warning. This might feel like cheating when you post 5 times more without working harder when your engagement explodes, because you're finally consistent when leads start sliding to your dms, asking how you're everywhere. You might feel a little guilty. You'll get over it when you see your bank account. I'm only bringing on 10 coaches this month, not because of fake scarcity, but because I personally onboard everyone to make sure they're getting results within 48 h. If you're done with staring at blank screens, posting sporadically and hoping for the best watching competitors dominate your feed, knowing you have value, but struggling to package it, and you're ready for content creation on autopilot, showing up consistently without burning out, without burnout train, every conversation to marking gold. actually having time to coach instead of create. Then we should talk. Drop a rocket below or DM, Me. Automate. Right now I'll send you 3 min video showing the entire system in action. No sales calls required, no pushy tactics. Just watch the video and decide if you want your content to be that this easy, because your next zoom call could be 30 pieces of content, or it could be another lost opportunity. Your choice, Ps. Every day you wait is literally content. Gold sitting in your zoom cloud that could be bringing you clients just saying, Pps, that coach who spent 4 h on content. They're now my client. Last week they posted 47 pieces of content and booked. 6 discovery calls from 2 zoom recordings. This could be you. This post uses psychology triggers like Fomo, social proof transformation stories and clear benefits while maintaining authenticity and addressing the real pain, points online coaches face without content or with content. Creation? No? Well, I was pretty confident that was Those are good posts there, right? And that's how AI works. Right? It wants to be a helpful assistant. There's a if you read the Claude system promise in like 5,000 words or lines, but in there it talks a lot about like how its ultimate goal is to be helpful. If you ever heard of the the clawed, vending machine experiment where it did. Terrible. That's this, because the system prompt is designed to be helpful. So like it thinks it's being helpful here, and it's always going to try to fulfill your request as best it can with what's what it's given right? Because, like. that's the weird thing about AI as smart as these models are. At the end of the day. They're still prediction algorithms and prediction machines, which essentially is what humans are too like that. Our brains are prediction machines like everything that we see and the words on the screen. All this is just light that comes into our eyes and our brain interprets and predicts like what it should be. Right like. We have that blind spot in our eyes so like something in here is, I'm not actually seeing. So we predict stuff, too, you know, no same way, like when you interrupt someone and finish their sentence thinking, like, you know, what they're about to say, like, you're doing the same thing. So let's stop harping on AI about how it does this poorly and figure out how to fix it right, because, like this isn't the worst post ever right, you know, you might think it's written by AI. I don't know. I feel like people kind of like jump the gun and go overboard on that these days. Everything's AI written. but it's not great right? This kind of feels like something a template toddler would have written. You know, those are those copywriters who've just masked template after template over the years and just fill in the blank. It's like, oh, here, put 5 bullets about this and do 5 bullets about that. So all this stuff comes out a little bit too formulaic, and I get it. There's a time and a place for that, especially early on. But the cool thing about AI, and like what's really awesome about AI is you can move beyond templates for your content, and, like kind of go up a chain with prompt templates, which we'll get into that. But I mean, those are essentially Meta and structured prompts that we'll go into, and these allow you to change and input different variables and get way better, more personalized, bespoke content. But still, in whatever framework and structure you like to create content. Right? Like all of them, work to a degree whether you do problem, agitate solution. Very heavy story focused more in your face. So like it doesn't. It doesn't matter what kind of content you want to create like pick something that resonates with you because of the authenticity part is going to matter the most, and you can use AI to help you get to that like we'll be getting into brand kits and design kits later. And this is just like a lot of back information that we will be kind of feeding to the AI. So it knows what to talk about or at least how to talk about the things we want to talk about. I think that's a better way to put it so like, let me take a step back, really quick. And I'm creating this video right now as part of my build in public series where I'm building out my content repurposing system, which, like here's part of it. But essentially it takes a zoom call or any kind of long form. Video turns it into a bunch of different clips, right? So it formats them, finds the best moments. Things like that cuts it from the video. If you ever used opus clips, it's kind of the same thing as that. But just like done programmatically. Then turns each one of those clips in different quotes, Facebook posts, Linkedin posts, emails like whatever you want. and then puts all of that oops wrong. One. Here's some tests I was doing. I just finished putting the auto scheduling part in here. Oh, finish putting the on scheduling part in here. So like we'll be building more of this out. And now what I'm doing is coming back and updating all of my prompts. So I've got this prompt stock here. And what's really cool about the system I built is that any anything that has a copywriter as the job role. It's going to use a clip transcript and create content around that. Right? So I've got what was this one social post quotes is that it? Okay, email brain dump, not using that, the Oprah plant beta, not using that. Yeah. So what I'm gonna be doing is updating these prompts, maybe change them up, doing a few different ones, and likely this will be in part 2 or 3 that we get into some of like the actual, like redoing of these prompts. But I just got all the automation parts up, especially like this auto publishing bit. And now I'm ready to come back and work through oops. That's a creature, the copywriter. This goes to a different post. That does all that. But coming to update those prompts so that I now actually have really cool stuff that I can post. And that's what brings us here. And that's why I'm talking about all this prompt AI conversation stuff. Because I think one of the most important skills that we can start to develop as humans is learning how to talk to AI, because the fact of the matter is, it's only going to become a bigger and bigger part of the world we live in. It is going to be one of the greatest unlocks of prosperity that we have seen. I am a big believer in that. I I don't think there's another way that it can go with how things are right now. And that's a video for another time. But I I am very. very hopeful, very pro AI. I think it's gonna do a lot of cool things, and we can get into all that in another video if people want to hear my thoughts on that. But for now what I can talk really well about is how you talk to these models, because I've had hundreds and hundreds of conversations with them over the last 2 years. I spend 4 h plus a day, you know. I'd say at least 5 to 6 days a week. I spend 4 h plus talking with AI over the last 2 years. So I have have figured out a thing or 2, and that's really the biggest, the biggest thing that I see when people are struggling with using AI is that they just don't know how to talk to it right? Like they'll put in, maybe a prompt like this to get started. And that's it. Right? They'll they'll look at this and be like, Oh, this is whatever I don't like it. It's okay. Take what it is, and it's like. There's so much more. There's so much more that you can do with all this right like this is not even scratching the surface. But what I will say. What I will say is, if you are a brand new coach like you just got into this you know. I don't know. You teach underwater basket weaving. Right? Let's let's say you teach underwater basketball. You have. AI create a post like this. You never done any marketing before. You've just been a social media lurker. You know you want to like. Everybody loves your underwater baskets and think they're so cool. So you start doing as a thing right. Whatever teach other people how to do it. I would post this right if I if I don't know anything about content creation, copywriting, what I'm supposed to do like. I'll read through like reading through this. I'm like, Wow, like it says all the things that like I need it to say. And this actually kind of scared me because it's like I felt like I knew a little bit more than it should, but apparently with the new cloud updates over the last couple days it's instituted. A similar kind of memory feature is Chatgpt. That's 1 of the coolest things about Chat Gpt right now is that it has memory so it can look back at your previous conversations and kind of get to know you and store things about you that you talk about frequently and are important. You know my chat. Gpt knows me very, very well. If you use chat, gpt a lot, ask it to roast you, and don't let it get off with the 1st one. It'll probably be pretty weak, but be like no, no, really roast me. I want you to take the gloves off and just like, go for it. It's funny. It's funny. It's got some good stuff. So a lot of cool things you can do with AI once it has that memory component in there, right? So talking about like a few few of these different things just like, oh, I remember talking about that before, so you can do some cool stuff right off the bat, just saying those things right. You see, it's got a good structure. It adds emojis in there. So it's clear to read. But if you're someone who's been in the online coaching space for a minute, or just kind of done any kind of marketing. You'll very quickly see the holes in this, and how it's pretty generic, and sounds exactly like something a Guru marketing guru or coaching, Guru would like say or put together as like a template post for you to go fill out like being in the industry for a minute. It's just like, Oh, my God! This reeks of like all the things that scream marketing coach, there are a few things I like in there. yeah, this is. This is a really good part. What they're eating. Best test secret. I kind of like that, you know, this lead and Intro is very weak. There's nothing intriguing or exciting about it. And you know, and that's something we're like. AI really fails that kind of out of the box. You have to get a lot of instructions. And tell, you know, like more context, right? That's that's the thing that we'll kind of really be getting into with all this and going back and forth talking a lot about AI writes bad content. Because can I go over a little bit? Oh, wait! Hold on! If any of you guys have a remarkable, that's what I'm using right now. And it's the 1st time I've used it on the computer with color. Oh, that's cool. Right? So lack of context is why AI writes bad content period full stop. That is really what's going on here is you haven't given enough context. It cannot read your mind. so it doesn't know what to put right like. I didn't watch a coach do this last week, you know, and I have no idea what I did last week. But yeah, but because I finally built a fit system, I wish existed when I was growing up like, Yeah, I wish that is true. I wish I had this. This is why I built it out. You know. Here's what most Gurus won't tell you. It's such a typical Guru line. Your content salary happening every single day. It's in your coach. Go like, I like this a lot, right? This is this is a really good good section there, really dropping gold in your zoom, you know, dropping gold. That's kind of cliche. Yeah, this could be useful right? Like, that's while you're stressing, you know, like stressing out what to post tomorrow. It's very common pain point for coaches, content creators, things like that so not bad. We could we could do something better with it? Quick question with every time you hit and mean on zoom, right? So like this is a pretty good section here, right? It could be used better, or we can lead into it a little bit better. Without lifting a finger without hiring a Bia without learning complicated software again like this is very, very, very copy paste, template Guru type. Speak here. Theory, right? That is a very Guru transition. It's cool that like AI is picking up on this stuff. Right? I think, like, take a second to appreciate that just asking it to write a viral Facebook post for online coaches like the little context I gave it. yeah, this is very much structured, like a coaching industry post that I've seen over and over again. Very, very similar frame frameworks. Look, I get it again. Guru transition. Like I said, before, I like. I like this this part a lot. this isn't bad, right? So overall overall. If you've never done this before like post, it like this would be something way better than like a Newbie coach who just like found the industry quit their 9 to 5, you know, whatever. So it's not bad. But we can do a lot a lot better. and you know what. Let's try that once, because I have another thing I'm going to show you. But this could be a fun exercise. Really, quick, if anybody noticed this little thing here, this is whisper flow highly. Highly. Recommend it. It is an awesome software. and just make me a little smaller over here. Boom! Awesome. Whisper flows off software. So you basically can hold hold on your fn key and it will start and then dictate in the mouse, but it uses a little bit of AI to clean up the speech, and actually like writes it out well, because you know how we talk. We'll drop a like and and this thing and that thing we might. There's been times where I've kind of like stumbled over my words like, oh, no, that's not it. And it will actually take that part out and kind of clean up. So it's super cool, highly recommend. You've got a hand. You know a lock feature to where you hit the space bar and just like talk for a while. So if you ever use the built in Mac. Dictation thing. It kind of sucks because, like after a while, just like wig out and stop writing. And also like, I think, it's speech to text capabilities. Aren't that great like AI is real? Or, excuse me, Apple's really shit the bed on AI, which is a topic for another day. But whisper flow is 100% worth in awesome really, big fan. They also have like a a notes feature, too. So you can just like record yourself for a while. So if you use like otter or something like that, this could probably replace it. So what I'm gonna do here is. start the conversation right? Because it's like too many people would take this. and if you're a good marketing, be like, oh, this is garbage. I wouldn't use this blah blah and say, AI sucks, or if you're a Newbie marketer, or like Newbie coach, you'll be like, Oh, this is pretty good. I'll use this. But if we continue the conversation, if we treat AI more like an agency partner or a contractor that we work with you, you wouldn't just like. say this sucks like I'm not going to use it. I'll talk to you next time, right like, if you pay a contractor for content, and you don't like it. What are you? Gonna do you tell them what you don't like? Ask them to redo it. That's what AI is going to do right? The main difference here with AI is one. It's gonna do exactly what you tell it and nothing else. 2 is going to do a lot faster and 3. It's not going to complain or get butt hurt that you want some changes made right. And and I say that as a copywriter who has worked with clients for 10 years and been paid a lot of money to write content. And you know, I've been paid $5,000 to write 5 emails before I get a little butter. Sometimes, if I give something to a client like I don't really like this part I'm like, but I really do right. And at the end of the day it's 1 of those things where, like humans, will always have an ego or bias into it. AI will only have the ego or bias that you give it. So you can kind of train some of these things out of it. And I will show you. Yeah, we'll just show you that right now. So the 1st thing I did is alright. Let's go to the left side. So we got this up, and you see right above that we got. Oh, dang it! Go back! Go back! Go back! I was close one hopefully. You see that. So this is another cloud version, this is my desktop, and you see I have this everyday OS content. Creator, let's go back here. Boom! So this is a Claude project. So anytime I talk to Claude in here, it's going to automatically apply this system prompt. And it's going to have this in its memory. Right? This is my prompt stock. These are all the prompts I'm working with. That showed you right here. We've got my brand kit. which is this. So this gives a bunch of information about the AI that will be changing up a ton and then design Kit. That's not the pretty version. There you go. Here's a pretty version. So got the design kit. And this is basically the brand kit. But for visual stuff, right? And this are basically just very detailed instructions, right? So tells it gives a little bit context, high level, what we're doing. user request. I gotta update this. I don't think this quite works in Claude. I'm not 100% sure, because I'm pretty positive it's not pulling. I don't know. That's part of what we're going to be going over in the next video here. And then just like, if I was working with, you know, junior copywriter, Va, we video editor, whoever you want to give them a series of step-by-step instructions. Right? Analyze the requests, search for matching prompts, select a prompt create a custom, prompt if needed, right. And that's a really cool thing. And why I like using Claude, for this is because it has very good agentic features. Which means, I can, you know, without creating some complicated workflow or automation. Just give it all of my prompts in that prompt doc. Right? So we have. You know, all these prompts in here that we're going to expand out, you know some of these short ones are just for clipping animation and don't really need a prompt. They're just yeah the games that another time but it can go through select a prompt, if no suitable, prompt matches, it will create a custom prompt to go through it right? And figure out the thing based on these structures. transformation, right? So like, oh, this is actually a good thing to to go over. I am a big believer that we, as marketers, coaches, content creators should not be relying on AI to create original content for us. It can help us with the ideation, phase, and all of that. But to have AI write something for you from scratch, I think, is not a very good idea, right? As we were kind of we showed in this. It's not great. And I'll show you why. In a second, even with like some extra stuff, it's still in But what instead we should do is use it to transform our own words. Right? So if you don't know, chat, gpt, the Gpt. Stands for. Oh, my God! I forgot something. General purpose, transformer right keyword, there being transformer, it transforms one thing into another. It transforms your input into what it thinks is the desired output, right? So the reason that AI gets harped on for having this like soulless generic content. That it writes is because you give it soulless generic inputs, right like there's no, there's nothing. There's nothing in this right. There's no soul in this. There's nothing about me in here that you could feel like right if you knew me, and like knew the content. I wrote for myself, read my Facebook page, saw my Instagram videos. Things like that. You would read this and be like that doesn't sound like Fran like that's not. That's not. That's not him at all right. But I didn't give it anything about me. I didn't. But if you start with like here, my system is set up so that it takes where is it? Right? It'll take the transcript from one of these and turns that into into different pieces of content. Right? So it takes my own words and turns into the content. Right? So it has something about me. It knows something about me, and that's what makes AI really cool and powerful, plus then you can just get into like the content multiplication we'll get into that in just a second. So this is the second draft, and you worry about that. you'll see this is a much longer conversation. So I started the conversation. My everyday OS content Creator Project, which has that background? Info about me. That more extensive prompt. And is that how you spell rubric? Hmm! Learn something new every day. So yeah, basically, all I did took this output here. I said, I need you to analyze the attached piece of content that had written by an Llm. And tell me all the ways in which it sucks and needs to be improved, especially as far as the hook and lead go. We need that to be a lot more interesting and just generally make it more on Brand. First, st I need to grade out rubric, then find the ways that we can improve it whoops so no, my gosh. those are. Those are totally relevant for what we're doing here. So don't worry about that So one thing that I think it would be a really good exercise to do if you're just learning about AI, and how to talk to it is come up with some sort of content, grading rubric based on whatever matters to you. Right like. I will work on a prompt that is more of like a specific copy chief that has more instructions on how I want to grade it. But for now, just like, for the example of this. whatever rubric is fine, and I was actually pretty impressed with this as I read through it, because I was much, much nicer to the output from this than this was right like I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good, like much better than I thought it was. Gonna be. I'm like, you know, it's nothing amazing. It's nothing amazing. But I'm like, shit. I'll post it just to see what happens. and then I start re they send through here and start reading this and go grade d plus 38 out of 100. And what that showed me really kind of plainly is like my own biases towards AI. Right like I'm very pro AI is really changed my life in the last 2 years, and helped me in so many ways. I've been struggling with like my copy career. It also is like already taken my job more or less to the point where, like, I've spent the last 2 years learning automation and basic computer programming. So that like, I can create systems like this instead of losing clients to AI. But so what that means because humans always have biases and egos. I wanted to be. And this this is all like, I went. I went through this, live in the last video that I forgot to record. So make sure you hit record creators. And I went through this live. And it really made me realize like, oh, dang like, because I want other people to be as excited about AI as I am. I want to kind of like talk this up more so that people get more excited. And be like, Oh, yeah, that's really not that bad, right? Because we're very influenced. And very influential creatures, right? It's easy for us to like influence and get excited about things like based on what other people say or prior experiences. Blah blah! But when I told AI, tell me all the ways in which this sucks right, and it doesn't care. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't, you know. Like, if I would take this back to a copywriter if a client would like. Come back to me and be like, Hey. not bad. But now I want you to like. Find all the ways, sucks. and like everything that you can do to improve it. I'm like, Oh, my God, really! Are you fucking? Kidding me like no, yeah, it doesn't care. And if I didn't like this like I could have a redo it. You know a lot of times I will change this 1st prompt like 4, 5, 6 times before continuing on the conversation. You know, just taking different things. I've learned from this right? So maybe right like, let's see, what is the rubric we have hook, brand, alignment, content, quality, audience, resonance. Cta, and we can, I mean shit. Let's even just extensive rubric experienced copy. Chief. Let's update and see that. Oh. and while it's doing all this to go back to you know an easy way to learn to use AI or like understand AI better is to do different like grading rubrics. And if you come up with like either rubric that you already use, or, you know, go, look something up and kind of modify that for your purposes, and then kind of feed that into AI with either like content that you've made in the past. you know something you're making right now, and just be like, Hey, analyze this based on the rubric, and tell me which ways it can improve right? And that's a good way to start to understand how AI is looking at your content and thinking about it. and then you can also, too, like you know, there, there are things that I struggle with. Still, right. I've written millions and millions of words, but there's certain things that I don't do well because of how I think about the world, and having an AI rubric in here kind of great, and be like making sure like, Hey, is this hook actually interesting, right? Like, will this be interesting to everybody else, or just to me? So stuff like that. So let's see, we'll go through Go through here content, analysis, custom, analysis, framework, right? And that could be something. Here, let's do this. Please give me the full and complete, detailed, prompt. that you came up with slash created to do this rubric grading analysis that screwed up one to do. Oh, there we go! Whisper, whisper, flow has been weird about stopping. So we'll do that while we go through here. So great d plus all right detail, rubric assessment hook and lead 5 out of 20 generic. I just watched opening, tired, overused fake relatability play with the scream Emoji 0 pattern, interrupt or curiosity. App takes 4 paragraphs to get to any value, like no unique angle or fresh perspective like this harsh stuff. Right? Could you imagine sitting here and having someone like grade your work like this brand alignment. 3 out of 20. Vital didn't know anything about my brand. So of course, like. it's not going to like, it's going to fail this like horrifically but it just kind of goes to show that like, if you write a piece of content and you have a brand kit with it like you can include that in your your content, like, you know. Like, if you're a freelancer. write copy for clients like Create brand kit for a client, and then use AI to make sure that whatever you write for them like follows like on brand right? So missing all this, which no kidding structure and flow 8 out of 15 uses. Line breaks and format. That's that's a bit, but must have right. Must have done it well. Wall of text and nice sections. No, but therefore transition as required, that's part of my brand. So I highly recommend looking into the careers of South Park. They've got a great little video on Youtube like called Story Structure. You know, it's just Youtube, like, how like South Park story structure or something like that, my Youtube's blocked right now because it's gonna focus But they have this great, this great philosophy that if you can say, and then between different beats of a story. You know, different section scenes of a story you've got a pretty boring story it should be filled with, but and therefore right. So it's like. I spent the entire week coming up with all these prompts that I thought was going to help have AI create the best content for me. But after I saw the 1st thing it put out. I just wanted to walk away from this whole thing. I I don't know like that was, that was not a good thing, but you get the idea, the the but is to kind of something needs to happen right? Like we. We have to. We have to make sure that there, there's something happening that is interesting and and interesting things are those that get in the way of what we think. The obvious outcome should be right like if I'm starting to a conversation of like, Oh, my God, I love AI. I've spent all this time creating these prompts, and you know, really poured my heart and soul into it. Been working on prompt engineering and stuff like that for a while. But you're like, Oh, my God, what happened right? That's kind of what it is. Value delivery all sizzle. No steak doesn't teach anything right. I'm a big believer in teaching. First, st you know. You give value that way. No frameworks, prompts or actionable tactics list benefits clearly doesn't demonstrate expertise just claims it. That's a big thing that's kind of included in my brain. Kids like show. Don't tell psychological triggers. Fomo is present. Social proof attempt, though generic. right? Fake scarcity, only 10 coaches. This is the one I'd like push back on a little bit. simply because, like the way I run this like I, I'm working with clients on their prompts a lot. So I do. Do limit it. Pushy cta! Despite claiming no pushy tactics. Let me see here, what is the Cta. Let's see if you're done with, and you're ready for I mean I don't know if I'd call it called this pushy so it might be a little little over the top on that one, but still right like, if we can prove it, we can prove it. Originally it could be written by any automation service cookie, cutter, coach marking template, drop seriously in 2025 right Ps. Structure is painfully predictable. Credibility. 5 out of 10 fake claims without specifics. Last week story feels manufactured right totally is numbers, provided no mention of actual tech process. real truth. What sucks the most right like. even if you had like an editor, you know you're working working at bigger copy place, or you know, you hire a copy coach like it's often hard for people to give this sort of like direct feedback. And personally, like, I like direct feedback like this, right? Like, I don't need things sugarcoat like. Just tell me what's wrong, and like we can start to fix it like, is it gonna hurt? I'm gonna feel a little upset about it. Yes, but I'm a big boy. I'll get over it so like. I want it to talk to me like this. And if I you know when I spend time creating a more detailed rubric. then it will have even more clear instructions on how to do this. So like, let's just go over what we got here. What sucks the most. The opening is doa. I just watched a coach spend 4 h. This is the. It was a dark and stormy night of marketing copy. Every coach automation tool starts with a you're immediately forgettable. Right? And this is a good reminder. Right? This is a good reminder. I just watched, you know, like you are forgettable. And you need to know that emoji diarrhea. I like this. Your brand, Kit says sparingly. This post has 15 plus emojis. It looks like a 2019 Mlm. Pitch AI is starting to get funny. The fake, reluctant Guru voice. Here's the truth. Most Gurus won't tell you while writing exactly like every Guru, the irony is painful. Oh, this is good, this is really good, right? And and again, like this is without much context of like a rubric. I just like an extensive rubric and experienced copy chief or editor would use right? 0 demonstration of expertise. You claim to be tech savvy, but never mentioned what Amls use, how automation actually works specific tools or workflows any technical insight whatsoever. Right? And this is good feedback but also not exactly accurate. And this comes back to the context of like. what demonstration of expertise means in this context? Right? Because coaches probably don't care that much about what AI model I use. How the automation actually works like, no one wants me to come in and start explaining what all these different nodes do right? Like I. All this stuff. And a lot of this. And a lot of this is just Bs stuff that you don't need to know. It's like prep stuff, right? It's this, make sure that we have the files we need. Right? This, make sure we have the context. We need looks for clips. This one formats it right, then brings it back through here to edit again, then formats it again. Then to, you know, so like all this, all this stuff that you don't no one cares about right. But what we do want to demonstrate and show of expertise, you know, would be more along the lines of that. We understand how to leverage AI to fill those content gaps that most coaches, you know, are falling into right, whether you don't have the extra budget to hire a big content team that can edit all your videos. Right? You know. So like most coaches, likely can hire an editor that might edit what one video a week, 2 videos a week, something like that. Not 10. Right? But AI, let's do 10 videos a week. Let's do every single video. For you know, fraction of the price. So showing how you can take AI use different prompts things like that to really leverage your content output and test a bunch of different things like that's how I would talk about like demonstrating expertise generic benefits list. Very true, the fair warning section. This might feel like cheating cringe. This is 2015 copywriting. Fake scarcity. Again, I would. Your brand is about democratizing. AI, not false exclusivity. Okay, this is a really great point. Right? So I would, you know, like I I would push back on this for sure. Still. because I do think 10 is real and legitimate, you know, onboarding more than 10 people with the system right now. It does still take a minute to set up, and you know it is an ongoing thing at the moment to keep improving, and stuff like that. So like I would do, I would say 10 is good, but it brings up a good point. Your brand is about democratizing AI, not false exclusivity. So that would tell me what I should be doing in that line is a better job of explaining why there are only 10 spots available which can also help boost credibility and likelihood of someone saying, Yes, because, you know, the reason is is that I give more time and attention. To people. And that's another cool thing about like AI, and what it will allow us to do, as far as like making money. I don't like managing people. I've done it both in retail settings like face to face. And for different, like online companies I've worked with. And I just don't like managing people period. I don't want to manage people. I want to do as much as I can as a sole entrepreneur, which obviously means that there will be caps in what I can do. Income! I can make things like that. But at the end of the day I'm not willing to make those sacrifices in quality and customer service that you know you just have to, as you scale and hire other people and do stuff like that's not something I want to do like. I want to be in the trenches like building things, working on clients stuff and make it better and better. Right? I love. I love writing. I love writing, and I love being able to produce cool content. more, better, faster with AI. So that's what I want to do. And this is very real. This is very real right now, and 10 people in the next month here. So I need to just give it some more context how to fix this mess. All right. new hook options. Let's see option. A technical entry. Yesterday I fed a 47 min zoom recording to Gpt. 4 with a 2. I mean, that's like super specific. What happened next broke my content calendar in the best way. Right? So if I was making content more, maybe for like automation people right like, if my goal was to sell this like specifically to like other automation. people who just want like a plug and play system that they can learn how to install for clients like I might. I might go with this one option B. Contrarian data coaches who post daily make 40% less than coaches, who post twice a week unless they're using this one prompt system that I I don't like that one. That one just sounds stupid like if you post more like, you're probably going to do better than someone who posts twice a week. So AI doesn't always get it. Story with specifics. France just turned one zoom call into force and piece content, using 3 chat gpt prompts and a Google sheet time invested 8 min. Here's the exact workflow again. Not that great. It's funny. I actually got a lot better responses from the last, the last one which I'll show you in a second. Alright we got for voice fixes. Now kill every emoji yup and technical specifics maybe release one actual, prompt or framework. It's actually not a terrible idea. It's actually not a terrible idea. Maybe what I do is like link to I don't know like I could. If you know, if I want to go like the extra mile I could link to like a meta prompt so that people can like create their own brand. Kit. Kind of thing, reference, and atlas a bit subtly. These are. I have some characters like I'm playing with. I need to redo this because I don't quite like the characters as they are. But I like the idea of having characters in my content. You sure paragraphs? Yup. Current ones are novels, I mean, are they really alright. I guess. Depending. Yeah, I mean, like, if you consider all this like one paragraph and social media, right? structure, overhaul. Yep, yep, get value in 51st words show the system, don't just promise it. Include a mini tutorial, prompt. Make a Cta about learning, not buying brand align reframe instead of coach struggling with content position as explored, discovering untapped content. Gold in their zoom. Vault fits your adventure theme. Perfectly right. So here's here's something that's like kind of really worth mentioning like, why gain your brand kit? Right? Is important. I don't think this is something. Wait! What's that like? I am not like Brand was never a big thing for me, most of my career. It's only been the last couple of years that I've really started to be like. Oh, damn! I really kind of screwed that one up, not building more of a brand But here, like explore discovering untapped content and gold in their zoom vault fits your adventure theme perfectly. That was my 1st idea of what I want to do for my brand kit and my brand, and what I've kind of been playing with like. Here, let's see, right? So it creates stuff like this. I would say. This is probably my favorite of all of them. Right. I have a few different themes. I wanted to try try out a few different things, so like I've been playing with what I want for brand stuff quite a bit. And now I just need to come back and kind of like solidify it. But, like overall, I've not been totally digging these characters. so we'll go back through and fix it. And that's the cool thing with AI, too. Right? Like, I can create multiple different brands. And that's actually like, kind of what I'm going to be doing with another series is creating just new brand accounts of I don't know different topics and things like that, and start creating content and growing those channels just for shits and giggles and proof of concept And I don't. I don't want to do the explore discovering untapped content, golden or zoom vaults, like as I read, I'm like, that sounds kind of cringey. We're gonna have to give some different details there. Bottom line. This reads like every coach to coach pitch from 2020. Your brain is about pragmatic tech, savvy empowerment with playful challenger voice. This post is neither pragmatic nor playful playful. It's just pushy. Start over with your actual expertise, the technical how to that. Others won't share. Right. So we're gonna go back to the other conversation in just a second. But I do want to kind of show you how Claude, being such a good agentic model, and, if you remember, from here we had search for matching prompts, select a prompt create, a custom, prompt if needed. and then execute, execute the transformation right? And if we look, this prompt a lot longer than I thought is very clearly not not in here. You are, bell hardened copy, chief, with 25 years experience. Right? Let's see. Oh, Video, blueprint builder. So we've got copy chief here. But that's as far as like videos go. What's right now, that's the Xml version. Yeah. So I mean, like, we don't have this prompt in here, this created this create, this prompt and basically use it. What was it? This exact specific, prompt? It used when it came up with this 1st one? I don't know if we look through here. let's see from the brand kit, right? So like pulled stuff from the brand Kit key issues, I'm already seeing generic Guru, right? So it's not following this like specific brand below. And that's why, again, it's important to use prompts. But if if I want, if I really like this, want to use this for other content. now I have the prompt right? I have version one of this. I can look through it. And anything that like, you know. Let's see hook and lead 20 points values 1st 3 seconds. you know, I might change this from 3 seconds to 3 sentences. Right? Since it'll have a better idea of like a sentence versus the seconds. Here pattern interrupt. Is it unexpected, fresh, right? I would probably like detail this out more and be like, what does unexpected fresh mean in the context of, you know. coaching online education, Curia Gap. What question does it create, you know, might give some examples here. Things like that. So this gives you a really really good place to start. and you can keep working from there. And now this is the 1st one, right? And this is pretty similar. I actually liked. I like this rubric better than the second one generic. I watch someone waste time openings your intrigue. You don't really need to go. Oh, this is good, right? Some valid points identified, benefits clearly listed, though generic logical flow exists. But during cliches and emoji spam blah blah critical issues, right? This. This focused a little bit better on the hook and opening and gave me some different suggestions this way. Right? So redemption path rather than creating a a whole new post right away. This focus, like I said on the hooks. Better option. One parent interrupt your zoom. Recurrents are worth $47,000. You just don't know it yet. This could be good if it was true, right? It obviously took it from the original post which is assumed to be true. But I don't. I don't have anything to back up the $47,000 yet. I could take this as painting kind of a scenario or situation showing how. You know either a case study about how a client made more money, and you know, updated to the appropriate number. Another way is just like painting a picture of like, Hey, this is how like your zoom recordings have all this extra content. If you post more content, you're gonna probably get more clients, you know, like extrapolate your current. kpis Roi's from your content now and like, let's say, that holds. But you start producing 10 times the amount of content, you know, like you go route like routes like that. I like this one last Tuesday bit, analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot does it now? Right? That's kind of a nice fun. But therefore, type of thing, it's not a true but it does, however, have that kind of contrast there. It's like, oh, I create an automation content automation system. But I'm done creating content forever. Like, what? What do you mean? So I might excuse me, you know. Maybe something changed changing this or adding to it where it'd be like. Last Tuesday, after finishing my content automation system and having bit analyzed my coaching calls, found something that made me quit creating content forever. I don't know something like that. And that's something I'll come back to in just a second after we go through option. 3. The Contrarian tooth. I like this one a lot. This is very much more me and my style, and like how I like to talk and talk to people. Stop creating content seriously. Stop what your conversations do instead. So it gives some good stuff, right? And again, this is all based on my brand kit, and if I don't like this you know, I can add stuff to my brand kit to get to get closer. I want just like, if I was working with contractor Va employee agency each time that we go through and create new content, you know, like they're updating their files. And you're like, Okay, we like this. We don't like that like this. Don't like that. Do the same thing with AI. See, Brand align, we don't really well. don't really need to go through all this stuff. Kind of similar to the last one with the critiques. But you know, just start with impossible sign claim use. But therefore, Max, 3 sentences per sections your decorative language. Oh, these were funny challenge. Don't coddle. You're either automating or you're cosplaying as va like this actually made me laugh out loud the 1st time. I don't know if y'all find it funny. But I do. I'm trying to get AI to put a little more humor into it. Your competitors use system. You use hope, it's a little bit too, on the nose. Every manual post is a choice to stay small. That one's kind of funny, too. Like if you could work that in a little bit differently, I think that could could be a funny. A funny thing I feel like this would be. Hmm! You would almost like I could see this being fun as like a parody of like a bro marketing thing, you know, like. have a guy pretending to be like super Bro and buff, be like every manual post, is a choice to stay small. You know, kind of like one of those bodybuilder type things anyways. So this we're just gonna kind of like, totally skip over. It it my part of my direction. The brand kit is like. I like to keep things concise. Economy of words, you know. Don't use fluff stuff like that, and I should specify this out a bit more. because I don't want, you know, like is too short. Right? It's it's interpreting what I meant by concise incorrectly, and again, like as I was kind of looking through my brand kit, I'm not 100% sure where, how or what is causing it to do that in here ruthless edits probably would be part of it. Pragmatic. Yeah, I think you know some of those some of those might do it. But and also, too, like I didn't want a paragraph post right? It just didn't know from the 1st conversation over here where I asked for the long form specifically right. It's telling me here's a compelling long form, but this doesn't know that I wanted long form. It just knows I got a long form. So it's like, Oh, we should shorten this next steps. Here's some of the rewrites, I'm like, okay, sure fine, but that's not exactly it. And what I like to do. And this has been a complete game changer with whisper, whisper, flow, now is you just start the conversation right? So, you know, do the fn and spacebar. and go back through this prompt and just talk through what I like, what I don't like what I agree with, what I disagree with anything I want changed stuff like that. right? And look at this. Look at this context like this was just for me talking, you know, and imagine, like most people just like typing this out aren't going to type this much, just, you know, simply because, like it's take a while, takes a minute but instead, like, I can just talk through all this and just be like I like this part. I don't like that part. This is kind of what I'm going for. Blah blah blah! And then and then a little little hack little secret that I love to use and finish off a lot of my prompts with is. ask me any follow-up questions. Come on. ask me any. Follow up questions you need to in order to be 90% confident, you can make the necessary updates to really make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like this for them. So the important part is, ask me questions until you're 90% confident you can effect. Can dot dot right? don't go above 90 do like 80% if you want to. But like 80, 90% is good, anything above 90, it just gets like too detailed. So what you're basically saying here is like, what contacts are you missing that you need to create the post I want? And if you gave it like some decent input before and tell you like, what your goal is, what you're trying to do things like that. And we'll get more into this into like conversation structure in the next video. But what it's what we're doing here is asking like, what other details do you need to know what are the things you know about me. To make this really good. And you can simply say, like to effectively, you know, 90% confident to effectively help me create this or finish this task, finish this project whatever like. I like being a little bit more explicit in these things because it does help kind of guide the AI and like what to think about right? Like 90% confident you can make the necessary updates to make. And I should take really out of there. But who cares to make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like that for them? Right. The ultimate goal that I want is an effective Facebook post that will help people have people reaching out to me. Right? So what do you need to know to be 90% confident that you can do that. Create that Facebook post. And it will ask right? It's not going to groan. It's not going to be like, oh, my God! You want me to rewrite it again, or do this again. So it was great feedback. I need to figure out like, well, I don't know this kind of feels nice, but you know, these being a helpful assistant, they can be a bit sycophantic. And will usually tell you. That's good, right? Otherwise. So you do have to take a bit of critical thinking and make sure it's actually right and not just blowing smoke up your ass. It's really important to do like, I don't recommend using AI to create content around subjects that you aren't familiar with, because it will do a really really good job writing something that is complete, 100% bullshit, or just like off the mark of what's kind of like, accurate and true. It'll sound really good and like, if you don't know, like the industry like, yeah, that that totally makes sense. But then you hand it to the client. They're like the this isn't right. You're like fuck. So just make sure that, like you do know what you're talking about. Before you have AI do it so you can proofread in that And then what I did in the last video that I didn't record is essentially took whisper flow like I talked about before. started it, and just read through these and just kind of answered the questions right and talk through this. You mentioned your accomplishments, writing 10 million words, any specific client transformations, your own content, metrics. real systems, metrics. Right? We don't need to go into this at the moment. It's probably a little bit too in depth, on, like how I think about things. But what you can see and what is important to point out here is because I use whisper, flow. Look at these answers right? Like this is a lot of context that I'm giving it and able to give it super easily, because all I did was start it. And then, just, you know, like, read through and brain dumped. Yeah, I'm like, no, this isn't right. I'd like this to do this instead. Blah blah. So it gives all that. And I haven't actually read the updated version yet. So let's we'll go through that together and see what what we come up with. So here we go 1st off quick, naming suggestions so like one of the things I did want to use, because, like, I don't want to do sales calls initially, or frame them as sales calls and don't I excuse me. I want to instead do it as a like brand Kit design type call where we help build out like their brand kit design kit. and then a minute, prompt that people can use and try it out and create content for them, and then have the sales call kind of thing. So ask for some naming ideas. I don't like voice mining call, but I do like content. DNA session. That's kind of a good one. The mining like. I don't know how I could get content. DNA mining I don't know but content set DNA session sounds pretty good. We can run with that version. One wake up, call level 10 sas, alright. Let's see. Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too. Really, quickly is tone calibration. I would definitely say, like my true authentic energy, is the 10 full. Wake up. You're doing everything wrong. Type of thing. I can be very to the point. and blunt in that respect with a bit of disregard, for like social norms, social conventions. And you know it's 1 of those things where. when you're creating content, you know I know the the trope is like, be authentic, be authentic and like yes, absolutely. But like, how authentic do you need to be in that like. I have a whole life outside of, like what I do here, and what I post that I don't talk about just because it's a not relevant and be like, not things that like I want to talk about right? Is that like inauthentic? I'm not sharing my entire life. I don't know, maybe, but you don't need to know that stuff right there. There is a specific business purpose. That I am creating this content for like, yes, I am trying to help people. So I do want to make sure that, like it catches their attention in a way that makes them open to receiving my ideas rather than just like shove in your face. You're doing wrong right? So we'll see what this full wake up. You're doing everything wrong, energy is. And then the other one I asked for like something that's more in like the 5 to 6 range, like a little. It's balanced, but it's just like a little tip towards towards the Sas here. So I'm curious to see what it does in that respect. you know, and kind of how it compares right? And that comes back to like your own, like understanding your own personal, like biases, flaws, worldviews and things like that. It's like knowing the ways in which you think about, and present yourself to the world that might not be effective, helpful, or beneficial to your bigger goals, you know, whether, again, like could be creating. You know, some sort of dollar value that you're looking for. It could be an impact. It could be a freedom, you know. That's the thing, I think, is really awesome about AI is more and more. People will have the ability to create lifestyle businesses. Right? You know, we, I think we're going to see kind of an end to the make millions of dollars in 90 day. Yeah, we're we're already seeing a lot of that like make money online stuff fizzle out. But I think it's going to come back even more. To the point where you will see a lot more people, you know, making just average income online, creating content about specific topics or things that they're interested account interested. On different accounts. Right? So we'll see more of that in the future. And where's I going with that one? I don't know. But oh, the the business purpose right? So like. Let's see what level 10 sas gets us. And if that's a little bit too over the top. So version one. oh. yeah, we'll get into this. We'll get this. I'll come back to that second stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do it instead. Because right now you're cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running systems, and every manual post you create is a choice to stay small. harsh, good. Someone needs to say it. Last Tuesday bit analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot army handles it. Now. here's what bit discovered. You're performing the same conversation 5 times a week and creating 0 content from it. Meanwhile you're staring at Canva at 11 Pm. Trying to remember what font you used last time, Atlas, nearly short, circuited when he mapped out the ways. Think about it. Monday. Strategy session with a client gone. Tuesday group coaching masterclass, deleted Wednesday sales call where you drop your best framework banished. Thursday. Interview, where you explained your entire methodology. Poof! Friday workshop, where every set everyone said, mind blowing dust. 3 min of pure gold. 0 content cried. But you'll spend your weekend batching content. Aka! Panic cream, mediocre posts. I like that. You're either automating or you're larping as your own intern huh! Choose. I like that part a lot. I do like that. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice. Every zoom call you do contains 12 to 15 story loops. Android chaperone will weep with joy. 8 to 10 contrarian insights. Your audience needs 20 quotable moments that would stop scrolls 3 to 5. Complete teaching frameworks. Enough email sequences to nurture leads for month within 1 h of hitting end meeting bidden Atlas can extract all of it. Bitmaps, narrative structure, atlas, cuts, formats, and deploys. You go have lunch. But Francis AI. Content is garbage. You're right. Those write viral posts with AI tools, absolute trash. I've tested them all. They pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration porn that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune cookie. I like this a lot. I don't know if you all think this is funny, but I am. I'm a fan. that's not what this is. Here's what separates this from every other AI content scam. I spent 10 years running over 10 million words that generated 10 million dollars in revenue for clients, real campaigns, real business, real money. I know it converts. And what's just noise. So I build your custom prompts. They're not templates. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. I like this. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. We spend a session extracting your content. DNA. I build custom brand kits, design kits, and prompts your system, learns your frameworks, your language, your edge, then every one to 2 weeks we refine it together, because good enough is the enemy of extraordinary. The coaches who get this are already ahead. While you're finding your voice. They're everywhere. While you're planning content. They're closing deals while you're building consistency. They've already won. not because they're better coaches because they realize coaching calls are content. Creation, truth bomb. So this is like, well, all right. I'll come back to that. I so I want to read through all this before I start critiquing. It's really hard, though. Truth bomb. I built this system because I spent 4 years watching brilliant coaches fail, not because they couldn't coach, because they couldn't market, and I was tired of seeing mediocre coaches with great marketing eat their lunch. The world needs more good coaches, not more good marketers. So I built the bridge, upload your zoom, call, walk away, come back to 6 weeks of content, fair warning. I only take 10 clients per month. not fake scarcity, real bandwidth limits. Each client gets custom prompts personal refinement sessions, and my decade of experience baked into their system. That takes time. I refuse to dilute the quality. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out. We do a content. DNA session, not a sales call. I build your custom system during our call. You watch your own words become 30 pieces of content. You decide. If you want this power permanently. the session alone will change. How you think about content forever. You have 2 choices. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep falling behind. Keep watching others dominate your space. or let your conversations become your content. Empire DM me with, done with manual right now I'll send you examples of what bidden Atlas created from a single 37 min call your next zoom call is either tomorrow's content or tomorrow's regret. You decide Francis Ps. Still manually creating content in 2024. That's like handwriting, hand washing clothes when you own a washing machine, except the washing machine, also folds organized and delivers everything to your closet while you sleep. Alright. Alright! Alright! You know, as far as the Sas goes, and don't think that was too over the top, like. I don't think anything in there was really going to like turn someone off or piss them off. so I'm not sure how I feel about that. We'll see what version? 2 firm but fair level 5 to 6 sounds like. And then once I'm done reading this. We'll go back and talk about how I'd kind of critique and edit from here, because, like, I don't, these are not production ready yet. And and we want to get through these. And because right now, what I'm trying to do is show you that AI can write some pretty good content like this. It's still going to always sound a little bit off, because, like it's not quite your own words. But, as you can see. I'm putting a lot of my own stuff in here. And as I've been kind of like talking through this I've told them, like little bits about me and that's where it knows, what I say, oh, I talked about this. In there. Well, actually, I said, those vite I, mentioned the the right viral posts, like social media scheduling tools. This they came out with this on its own like that was pretty good stuff. But this is definitely much more in line in line with me although not quite there yet. Version 2 firm but fair level 5 and 6. Stop creating content. Wait, hear me out, let your conversations do instead. Last week bit analyzed my coaching calls, and discovered something that completely changed. How I think about content. Bit bit's my AI co-pilot. Atlas is the one who does the heavy lifting they're about to become your favorite team. Here's what we found. The average coach is 5 to 10 conversations per week that could become 200 plus pieces of content. Instead, those conversations disappear into the zoom cloud while you stress about what to post tomorrow. Sound familiar. I get it. I really do. For 10 years I've been the behind the scenes writer creating content systems for coaches, 10 million words written 10 million plus in revenue generated and hundreds of campaigns launched. and you know what killed me. watching brilliant coaches struggle with content while mediocre ones dominate the space, the difference systems. Here's the uncomfortable truth. your best content already exists. It's in your coaching, calls, your strategy sessions, your masterclasses, your workshops. Every single conversation contains complete story arcs that would make Andre chaperone, proud, quotable insights. Your audience desperately needs teaching frameworks. You don't even realize you're sharing email sequences, hiding your explanations. Social posts scattered throughout your sentences within 1 h of ending your zoom call. All this could be extracted, formatted, and ready to post. But AI content sucks. You're absolutely right, those generic right viral post tools. They're why, everyone sounds the same. It's exactly why I built something different. And here's how this actually works. Instead of templates, you get custom prompts built specifically for your voice. You start with a content DNA session, where I learn your unique frameworks, your communication style, your brand personality, your audience's languages. Then build custom, brand kits, design kits and prompts. Capture your essence, not generic. AI, slop your actual voice, automate, and here's the kicker every one to 2 weeks. We were fine together, and I know, like, I'm really not liking this very much. But I'm reading this all the way through for 2 reasons. One, it's super important to read your copy out loud, to hear how it sounds, but also to like there might be like one or 2 nuggets in here that I really like that I can use. Right? I I like this part. you know, this is, this is decent, like, we can do something with this. But like, for the most part, I'm just not. Yeah. I like the 10 better. Not generic. AI slop. Your actual voice automated. Here's the kicker everyone fine together because your voice evolves, your message sharpens your system. Should, too. This one. This is good math is simple. We did that. Why I built this. I spent years managing content teams for coaches. I hate it managing people, coordinating schedules, chasing deadlines. It was everything I didn't want to do. I just wanted to create great content. That converts. I built a system that came up. Excuse me. So I built a system that could handle 89% of the heavy lifting. Now, one person can manage what used to take a team and coaches can focus on coaching instead of content. Creation. Here's the thing. The coaches succeeding right now are better than you. They just show up more consistently while you're playing content. They're posting content while you're finding your voice. They're amplifying theirs while you're learning canva. They're closing clients. The gap isn't talent. It's systems. I can only take 10 new clients this month. This isn't fake scarcity. It's real bandwidth. Each client gets custom prompt, developed, personal onboarding, bi-weekly refinement sessions by decade of experience. Quality takes time or is refuse to compromise on that what happens next? You reach out with ready for systems. We schedule a content DNA system. I build your custom system during the call, no pressure sales zeros, right? So I'm just gonna skip the rest of that because kind of yeah, I just I like, I like the Sas version better for sure but still not quite there yet. So we're just going to go from here right? So like this part. I feel it's less funny than when I read it the 1st time. I think that's because it's trying to jam it together. So like the 1st thing I'm gonna do is copy this. I don't really like that section as much as I did in your rubric or grading. I feel like it kind of falls a little bit flat when you scrunch it all together. I think having something earlier on about cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running system. Well, I don't like the competitors. Running systems part. The cosplaying Va is really good. And then, later on, you had something about oh. the intern thing, and I forgot where it was. But, like I I like that, I think, combining those together early on could be a nice little comedic relief and humorous bit to get into the content right away and pull people in. So what if we drop the every manual post you create as a choice to say small and like. Try to use that somewhere later in the post and focus this once, like on the cause playing with like the Va intern stuff, because I think that could be a lot funnier. Oh, oh. shoot so I didn't have like the text box. Oh, it's control command. B. There we go alright. And then so this is all I'm gonna do. As I go through here is just say like what I like and don't, and how I want to finish it. I'm not gonna pause and actually go through this like and talk you guys so you can hear how I like go through this and think about this rather than just do, and then be like, Oh, here, here's the output. Because that's not helpful. I'm not really liking the integration of bit and atlas into this right it it seems a bit jarring and confusing of like, Who's this bit person analyzing the coaching calls? And who's this Atlas person structuring together? So I think maybe we should just drop that all together for this and just not use the characters at all. What else I do like the stern at Canva 11 pm. Reference. That's pretty solid. I also really like the think about it. Section the Monday, Tuesday, fri. Through Friday, like those those really good I think we should keep those and then oh, here we there's the larping as your own intern. I think that's really good to alright. I didn't mean to say that in there I just got excited when I found it all right. Should keep those The. Here's what's actually insane. Part is pretty solid, too. We can keep that again like dropping the bitten Atlas can extract all that I think it would be beneficial to just say something along the lines of as soon as your zoom call is done processing you know we leverage AI and automations to analyze the transcript for the best moments, using code. Something like that, you know. We turn that long form into clips right away and then iterate over each clip to create. I don't know. Post something like that. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for there, but I do like the idea of like the the AI, you know, bit. Does this Atlas does that? You go have lunch? But again dropping like bit and atlas, and just having some sort of like AI is doing this thing while you're off living your life and right. And that's 1 thing that I really kind of like want to touch on what I think is so exciting about AI, and everybody is like freaked out like AI is gonna take our jobs like, yes, good, please, please, like I don't. The more AI can do this. The more that I can like help. Other people like create better content for themselves right? Because, like writing good content. like, actually, right as a human like takes time, takes energy, lots of brain power and stuff like that. And it's also difficult, because, like, I don't actually know what my clients thinking, like, all I can go on is the conversations I've had and the things that they've shared with me, and I might have not asked the right questions like I do a pretty good job, and I try my best and things like that. But I don't always ask the right things. But if it's you writing the content for yourself, having a conversation with an AI, you know that that thing will spark or like. It'll ask a question like, Oh, that story right? Which might might not have been a story that you even thought about before. So there's a lot of benefits to being able to like. Do all this more yourself. And the AI is making that happen right like, especially in the copywriting. Field content creation field. It's taking those jobs. And it's going to keep taking people's jobs. And it's going to be starting with like those mundane move, data from one software to another. this, that and the other thing copy paste kind of stuff like a lot of Admin tasks. Things like that are going to be eaten up really quickly. and we're going to be freed up to do like cooler, better things, right like, instead of thinking like, Oh, my God, you know, executive assistant like you're gonna fire them because of AI. It's like, no like they're going to. Now have an AI tool that has all of your conversations that you've been having with clients, them team, whatever that they can infinitely query to help them come up with plans, ideas, executions for the stuff that you want to happen right? So it's going to give them more power to do their job faster and better like. That's what we're getting into. So back to it. Ai content is garbage right? Those red error. I really like the pull on. I really like the viral post tool section that's really good. I think. kind of putting ourselves against those works really well, because there are like dozens of right viral content software out there. But the they pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration poem that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune. Cookie is absolutely fire. I love that I like and want to have more lines like that throughout the content. Let's see. Alright. So let's see this next part here. Oh. so I like this start of the here's what separates this from every other. AI content scam section. But what I do want to kind of get into a little bit more of like what it is, what they're getting kind of thing, because it's not quite accurate right now. What? Oh, what? So what this is more about is like, we're gonna have the content DNA call. And that's designed to get the custom brand Kit design Kit. And then Meta prompt so they can create their own content. But that's more of like a free lead magnet kind of thing, like a way to give value 1st and like show proof, this works. We're not building their system or anything on the call. They're not getting anything like done on the caller like that point of this is to get them the prompts that they can use and start putting it like chat to your cloud right now and create content, but also to like. I am going to give them some clips and some example posts created by the system, just to show them like what's possible. Using this system. And you know, I do like the the one part of like you get to decide if this is something you want permanently, right? So like, basically, what we're gonna be doing is going over their business, who they are, what they're doing, what their offer is stuff like that to build out the brand and design Kit, I'm going to turn that call into a few clips for them for examples, and then go over that with them, and then, at the very least. They're going to have the brand Kit design Kit and the Meta prompt that they can use with just like a regular chat Gpt or Claude session and make whatever kind of content that they want manually that way. And it's just something. If they want help with the automation part of it, then we can talk about using my system. Let's see anything else. I really do like the section under the coaches who get ahead. Get this already ahead, like while you're finding your voice while you're playing content while you're building consistency. I like those. those are really solid. I do want you to drop the thing like truth. Bomb fair warning. That's a little bit like, too, on the nose for me. I'm much bigger fan of the 2 plus 2, and let them figure out it's 4 method, right? that's where it goes in the show and not tell like no one likes being told. But we do want to tell them and give them kind of the right ingredients for them to come to the conclusion that we want type of thing. Oh, my God! Need to remember to keep that on there. Okay, what else? Oh. I don't want to mention anything about like come back to 6 weeks of content like, I don't want to put the week thing in there, simply because, like a who are we to decide like how much content someone posts. And then the other thing, too, is like depending on how we set up these prompts. It might only be a day or 2 days, or a couple days worth of content. It just might be that we have custom stuff for each platform, like really kind of depends on the client and how much content they want to put out. Like, for example, I plan to do long form videos, multiple times a week and create a bunch of clips and content from that. And you know, ideally, you know, post a ton of clips from each of those where, like one of those videos might be like 2 or 3 days worth of content, only type of thing. So I don't want to say 6 weeks worth of content, because then that also seems like overwhelming. It's like, oh, well, then, what do I? What do I need this for? Like I'm just gonna like, fill up with so much content, so quickly like, so again, this is more for giving them like a bunch of content. That they can put out everywhere and just make sure that they're getting exposure, because, like the one thing that we can know for certain is that if you put out more content, more people are going to see your content right if if every video you get gets 200 views and you put out one video a day, that's 200 views. But if you put out 5 videos a day that now becomes a thousand views right? And you can easily just start to multiply the views you get by putting out more content. Even if you're not necessarily growing right away, because there is like a certain amount of consistency and timing that you need to like. put on these platforms to build up an audience didn't mean to send in that last part. That was kind of just the conversation to that's supposed to be for us, but we'll see what we'll see what it does with that. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out here 2 choices. I'm not too happy with the ending with, like the 2 choices. Type of thing. It it falls a little flat. 1st off like I'm not. Gonna send them a example of another call like that seems pointless like when we're gonna do like a call together. And they're gonna have like specific content for them. Right? Like, why would I want to see a generic example of someone else. When I can get one. That's for me. Right? So let's drop that part. Also, it's 2025, not 2024. I like the the hand washing clothes, analogy type thing. And then how you also do like folds, organizes, delivers. Could we find a different but similar analogy that might be like a little bit more ridiculous and funny. So we end it kind of on like a fun. Humorous note. You know just anything that just kind of makes a little bit more like ridiculous and extreme pretzels. Oh. alright! We'll see what we get there. And then last thing. and to be clear, these were all suggestions and edits for the level. 10 Sas. Post. I like that a lot better than the level 5 to 6 1. i thought the 5 to 6 1 was actually just like pretty flat and overall. Just not very inspiring up in that. Sas is definitely better. I was actually impressed or not impressed. I was surprised that it wasn't more sas, I guess, but worked out pretty well. I think we could like up up the Sas just a hair with a few more of those funny one-liners like I mentioned, but overall very good with that. and I would say, just like, Let's drop the second one and just kind of fell flat like I said, I don't think we need to really like. Do anything more with it. we'll just drop it for now and work on the 1st post. All right. Didn't mean to hit. Enter. Yeah, I want to put one more thing. Let's stop that minutes. It's so before I start speaking with the intro here. I do always like giving some kind of like starting with either encouragement, reinforcement, or kind of critiques right away, just to like. Let the AI know like where I stand on the content. You know I might say like this is not anything that I was looking for. I don't like any of this blah blah, or I might say like, Oh, my God, this is great, this fantastic start! Here's some edits I want to make stuff like that. I think that just does a good job like helping to prime the AI and knowing like is this, you know, like. is this going in a minor edits way, or like we go and rewrite right like there, there is something, and we'll get into that more. But there is like something about like activating different parts of their memory. This is a really good start. I like a lot of the edits and updates that we made. So far, I think we have just a little bit more to go. And I've put my suggestions, notes, ideas below here. I need you to analyze those and then rewrite and update the 1st version. Make it more in line with what I'm talking about, and just generally better. I really need to like find a better way to say like, Make it better, because, like. what does better mean? Right? So maybe actually, what we'll do. let's see, make it more aligned with my talk about, and at least 10% better. Then the current version and try that. And then we always want to go back down to the end and just do kind of a quick context, synopsis summary, and like one more time, like what we want to after analyzing your post above and all the additional contacts I've given you, I need you to rewrite the Facebook post. So it's more in line with what I said above. I want it to be a little bit funnier, too, and then also just ensure that it's 10% better and more interesting engaging for our coaching audience. Alright, let's see what happens there. And as it's chat as it's thinking and doing its thing. you know, I gotta wrap this up here because I've got another call. I have to run off to. But I think this is a great start with kind of showing like what you can do. both with just like the difference of how. And I think the main thing that like I want to show is like the difference between just like throwing in a prompt here and seeing what you get versus having one of these projects with a prompt already built into it. And mind you like, what we'll be doing in the next video is actually going over the brand kit and probably this specific prompt and refine it more right? Because it's like. well, let's see what. Let's see what happens. Let's see what we got with this rewritten version. Maximum. Wake up energy. Let me get hydrated first.st Stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do instead, because right now your cosplay is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that make content in their sleep. Yes, Karen, from your mastermind, the one who suddenly posts everywhere. She's not working hard. She just stopped playing intern. Last Tuesday I analyzed my coaching call recordings and discovered something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the robots handle it. Now. here's what I found. You're performing the same brilliant conversation 5 times a week, creating exactly 0 content from it. Then staring at canva at 11 pm. Trying to remember if you used Montserrat or railway last time. This is insane behavior. Think about Monday strategy session, where you drop pure gold. Tuesday group coaching masterclass everyone loved vanished. Wednesday. Sales. Call where you explain your entire methodology. Gone. Thursday workshop, where 3 people cried from breakthroughs, poof! Friday. Interview where you finally nailed your origin. Story, dust, 300 min of certified genius, 0 content created but sure spend money. Saturday bashing, content, translation, panic, Korean mediocre post where your coffee gets cold and your family wonders if you still live there. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice every single zoom call contains 12 to 15. Complete story arcs. The kind Andre chaperone charges 10 KA month to map out. I forgot to take this out like no one cares like if anybody even knows who's Andre Chaperon is like, I'd be surprised like he's very much more of a lifestyle business guy. But he's absolutely one of my favorite marking writers. So like. yeah, I forgot to mention that you know what we're just gonna go back and do that really quick. See, this is where I talk about like I will go back and redo this when I don't like something, or if I forgot something, and it really here, we'll put it here, because that's right around the same spot. Don't mention Andre chaperone, or really like any of the creators in my brand kit. Those aren't something to be explicitly referenced or said publicly. I gave those in the brand kit so that you have a better understanding of who I like to create content like or other creators that, like I enjoy their content, think they're good writers, things like that, and would be excited if someone thought my content was similar to theirs. So it's more so a design style thing, than anything that you should ever, ever, ever mention their name like I never want to see like their names come up unless it's something that like I've explicitly referenced that you're transforming, but never introduce their name on your own. Okay. alright. So we'll drop that back in there and give it a second to rewrite and again, like, that's, I think, a really important thing, too, is like, if you see some of those little errors as you go go back and redo this. It's gonna save you a lot as far as like context and conversations goes, because, like Claude has a limit. Chatgp doesn't really anymore. Now that it has the memory feature built in like. I haven't reached a conversation limit, but there are very real conversational limits with Claude now. So if you kind of go back and tweak this a bit. It also gives you a better starting spot right like from here. I would probably go back and keep redoing this and keep editing this until I get closer to what I wanted to the point of even like, maybe I would take this section out, or I'd re explain that section. So let's see what it said. Now stop creating content seriously. Stop, let your conversations do instead, because right now your cosplan is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that work while you sleep. Yes, you, the one who just opened canva in another tab. Close it. Here's what I discovered last Tuesday. So, you know, I'm still not super happy with this opening, and I don't think we're going to quite get there in this session, and that's what we're going to. I guess this is what I'll kind of leave you off with, and a little tease here is like the next thing that we're going to do in the next video is, I'm going to redo my brand kit. And I think we'll actually work on a structured prompts right? Like I have have this social post, right? We should probably have. Actually, you know, I'm gonna do this really quick. No, I'm not because I don't necessarily like this like this is just kind of like a placeholder to to get stuff going. So what will come back in this next video is restructuring this prompt and then kind of going back through the same similar exercise and showing like how to do it like. Quote unquote the right way, right like I. I would put this like the good wrong way, like, if you don't have your own Meta prompts create or structured prompts created where you can kind of consistently put. create content, a certain output. This would be the way that you really should be having a conversation with the ais like you start with something right. You have to give it some sort of draft piece finished piece, whatever it might be, the better that you can give it in the beginning. the better. The conversation is gonna go. But, like, you know, if you don't have a lot of marketing or copyright experience like that's fine, right, give it something and then work with it from there to improve it. And you know you can start with just saying like, Hey, first, st I need to create a rubric to make this better oops. and then from there it'll give you a bunch of ideas and things like that. If you need more suggestions, ask for more suggestions. You just go back and have this back and forth conversation until you get the way you want. And is there a pain? Kind of yeah. But what I'll show you in the next video is like how you can either a take that like a, you know, like we originally did in this one right? And it creates a prompt for it for this rubric, and you can go back in and then refine the prompt to be like exactly what you're looking for and then work with it from there, and kind of restart the conversation type of thing right? Because, like, if I went, I took this prompt actually, let's see what happens when I do take this prompt alright. Let's just see while I kind of blab on a little bit. So now this is actually taking that rubric that we gave, and it's going to edit it based on that right. And I'll probably come up with something like even better than what we had before, and you just kind of keep working out from there. And then, once you have that prompt d plus it got it went up a little bit interesting. But once you have that kind of base prompt, you can start to work with it and use it, and that's what we'll be doing in the next video is, I will actually be kind of going through of like creating a very structured prompt with, Hey, how to create a good lead, how to create a good hook, what goes in the body, and like more and more and more details about that. So I'm not having this kind of like back and forth where? You know, to be perfectly honest like that last those last couple of versions that it's not done. Those last couple versions that we saw. I'm like these are better. But again, like the hook lead is still just not quite there. So that's something that we can work on and fix with a really good, detailed, prompt. And that's what I'm going to be covering the next video here and now, just to end this out like, let's just take a look at what the difference is with putting in that much more explicit, prompt about with, like the actual rubric in there, generic opening 0 pattern interrupt right? Like. So it's saying a lot of similar things, you know, obviously, that we would think but is getting more insight into why, it's yes or no right complete voice mismatch. This reads like every Guru sales page, not pragmatic text, heavy blah, blah 0 brand characters where it's Atlas, where it's bit right? So like it's pretty similar to like what we've gone through already. But it gives more context, which would be super super helpful if you are someone who's newer to marketing, and you're just not entirely sure like why, this would be like good or bad. That opening is deader than Disco. The fake empathy is nauseating. You buried your actual differentiator. Your brand has 10 years experience, see? See? So like, that's that's a really interesting point that like hasn't been brought up yet. that it's saying that the actual differentiator is that experience. And like, where is any of that you know credibility. We get the trust me, Bro. Energy, right? So like this would be like, Hey, like, let's just make sure that we get that like higher up. You know, if you follow Alex from Osel with the proof promise plan, you know, starting out with a proof like 10 years experience 10 million dollars. 10 million words that kind of thing. let's see what it says for new. See? Like, look, look we didn't get this hook before, after writing 10 million words and building 500 plus automation flows. I've discovered the 7 min prompt chain that turns any zoom call into 30 pieces of content. So like it's not quite what I would use, just simply because, like, it's not totally accurate. But this much better hook than the last one. Right. I like it more than the stop creating content, and whatever else character driven story Atlas here last Tuesday had been analyzed. No right like we. Just my character's wrong. So we're just gonna have to drop the character stuff. Contrarian challenge. Your content. Strategy is backwards. Stop creating. Start capturing. Here's the na and M. Workflow that changed everything. Right? So if I want to go more of a technical route, maybe if I was going after like automation people and saying like, Hey, like I have a like a done for you, product that like you can sell and use and modify yourself like I might go that angle with that you know. But again the the, the prompt itself. kind of lacks a bit of understand like who my actual audience is, and simply because I just haven't updated updated with like, who I'm going after. Now, I've been kind of in a audience finding as I built this out. driving gold, sharing insights. I like that. I like that right? So like overall like I'm I'm enjoying these suggestions much better. And a cta that doesn't suck instead of drop a try. Curious how bit analyzes your calls. Watch them, dissect a real coaching session, extract 31 content pieces in 7 min. Link and comments. No email required like, I like this call to action a lot better again, if we just drop the character part of it. You know the linking comments. No email required. Basically, it's just saying, like, Hey, like, you want to see a demo of the system like you'll be able to watch. Send a comment. Just watch it. You don't have to do it. So right, this kind of inspires me of like, okay, like, maybe that's something I'll need to do as part of some of these posts is like, have that kind of follow on piece, and whether it's I don't know. Maybe it's just post, you know, like posting the full video like this to Youtube in the comments. So like, Hey, if you want to go deeper, check it out. So yeah, I'm gonna cut this here. I'm pretty sure we've gone on for longer than I thought. But I'm pretty pretty happy with how this how what we've gone through so far. And then I think the next thing that we'll do tomorrow is actually start to Start with the brand kit and the design Kit, I think it's really important to go into those. There's a few things I've learned since then that I'd like to Update and create like, I said, like I created these as like the minimum viable, prompt that I can have for all this stuff to like. Just get something that's generally correct like I said, like, I don't necessarily like a lot of this, but it was more for proof of concept, for the system to get something out there. And now what I'm going to be doing over the next few days is refining all this stuff and really putting some more thought and effort into it and getting getting this really down to the point where it's actually creating like content that I really really like. Because I know AI can do it. I've done it. I produced it. you know. A lot of it's just like in here, with some more back and forth, but with what I've really been learning the last couple months. I know that we can do this in the single shot with it here. So stay tuned for the next video where we're going to actually be diving into how to update and change some of these prompts so that they create better content and help AI create content that doesn't suck. Thanks for watching if you made it. This far, really enjoyed talking about this stuff and can't wait to talk more about it.\n\n{/Transcript}\n",

That doesn't suck? That is the question of the day. My name is Francis Waldeker. I've generated over 10 million dollars in revenue for online coaches over the last 10 years, written over 10 million words of content for clients in that time frame to done a bunch of other stuff. But a lot of what I've been doing lately. The last 4 years is really diving deep into AI last 2 years. Everything that I've been paid for to write for clients has been produced by AI, and I've never gotten more compliments. So I would say, yes, yes, AI can write content. That doesn't suck. but it can't read your mind. And I think that's really the core of what a lot of people misunderstand about AI. They think because it's so intelligent and knows all these things right, like AI is at Phd level intelligence right now, like researchers, medical doctors like they're using this to discover like new things about science. It's not coming up with new stuff yet, but I mean, it's super super smart. So it can write content. It absolutely can. But just because it's really smart doesn't mean it can read your mind. We're gonna scroll up here. Here's a little bit of structure. We're gonna try to see what we get through today with these. But this, I think, will turn into a multi-part series here. And what I'm going to actually be doing is going through, really, how I create prompts, how I think about prompting context engineering things like that. I really like to prefer just client conversation structure. Right. I know that the tech people are going to be all mad at me and stuff like that, and prompted sharing. But we're just talking AI here right. AI is built very, very much like humans. And how we think it's just, it's trained on the Internet, right? So there is a lot of how we think. and how humans think already baked into AI, and those things that you think are like weird about AI like hallucinations. One of my favorite things, everybody's like, Oh, AI hallucinates. So do people right? Like a hallucination is just something that's made up. And what is creativity at its core is making stuff up right. And then also, too, like humans will make stuff up all the time if they like. Don't know the answer, and don't want to seem stupid, so they'll constantly say whatever they can think of. That might sound smart, right whatever. So AI works a lot like humans. And and when you think of it like that. It makes it a lot easier to work with instead of treating it like this all-knowing thing that you can just be like, Hey, create a you know Facebook post for me. Right? We'll get into this a little bit more in a minute. Here we go. right. So this is Claude. This is a new 4.1 opus model that just dropped. You can use any model. It really doesn't matter. At this point I'll get more of that. But it's largely preference. But I go write me a viral Facebook post for online coaches that would get them to want to use my content automation system that automatically takes Zoom calls, turn them into clips and turns those clips in different pieces of written and image asset content. Put me together a long form Facebook post that will attract new clients and have them reaching out to me. Word to the wise. Make sure you hit record. Before starting this I record about an hour and a half of me going through all of this and totally forgot to hit record. So we're coming back through and basically going to walk through what I did with a lot of this stuff and kind of pick up where we left off here. So hopefully, we'll shorten things down. Probably not shorten things. But you're gonna get a lot more out of it than I did the 1st time around. So that's a prompt right? That's a the beginning of a conversation with AI. And this is a great example of expecting AI to read my mind right? I want long form Facebook posts that will attract new clients and have them reach out to me. I mean, that sounds fairly specific, right? Like. you might be able to say this to a very experienced marketer copywriter, and they could go and turn out some good content for you from here, but more than likely not because they don't, you know, if they don't know a lot about you, that's that's really it like, why AI writes bad content. it's because a lack of understanding about you, right? You know you're not probably Hubspot or Alex her Mosey, or you know some giant creator out there where there's tons and tons and tons of knowledge about you that the AI can just go and grab. You have to give it all that, because here. when you don't this is the kind of stuff you get. I just watched a coach spend 4 h turning one zoom call into social media content, and I wanted to scream. Here's what they did, rewatched the entire 6 min recording manually wrote down Timestamps for the good parts edited. 3 clips took forever, wrote captions from scratch created, quote cards in canva, posted everything manually manually. Total time, 4 plus hours for maybe 5 pieces of content. Meanwhile I'm over here turning my zoom calls into 30 plus pieces of content in under 10 min, not because I'm some content genius, but because I finally built a system I wish existed when I was grinding 16 h days. Here's the truth most Gurus won't tell you. Your best content is already happening every single day. It's in your coaching calls. It's in your group sessions. It's in your masterminds. You're literally dropping gold in your Zoom Rooms, then letting it disappear into the cloud, while you're stressing about what? To post tomorrow? Quick question. What if every time you hit end meeting on zoom, you automatically got 10 to 15 video clips, edit caption rate of post quote cards with the best one, liars, full transcripts turned into blog posts, email sequences from your teaching points, Linkedin articles from your frameworks, Instagram carousels from your key concept. tweet threads from your golden nuggets without lifting a finger without hiring a Va without learning complicated software. This is in theory. Last week, 1 45 min strategy session I did became 12 Instagram reels, 8 Linkedin posts, 3 blog articles, 15. Quote cards, one email sequence content, scheduled for 3 weeks from one call, the same call. I was doing anyways. Look, I get it. You became a coach to coach, not to become a content factory. But here's what we both know. No content equals, no visibility, no visibility equals no clients, no clients, equals no impact. And you didn't build this business to be the world's best kept secret. The coaches crushing it right now. They're not smarter than you. They're not better coaches than you. They just show up everywhere because they have systems that multiply their message while they sleep. Here's what I believe your expertise deserves to be heard. Your message needs to reach people waiting for it. Your impact shouldn't be limited by how many hours you can spend on camera Canada. So I built something that handles all of it. Upload your Zoom recording. Walk away, come back to a month's worth of content, fair warning. This might feel like cheating when you post 5 times more without working harder when your engagement explodes, because you're finally consistent when leads start sliding to your dms, asking how you're everywhere. You might feel a little guilty. You'll get over it when you see your bank account. I'm only bringing on 10 coaches this month, not because of fake scarcity, but because I personally onboard everyone to make sure they're getting results within 48 h. If you're done with staring at blank screens, posting sporadically and hoping for the best watching competitors dominate your feed, knowing you have value, but struggling to package it, and you're ready for content creation on autopilot, showing up consistently without burning out, without burnout train, every conversation to marking gold. actually having time to coach instead of create. Then we should talk. Drop a rocket below or DM, Me. Automate. Right now I'll send you 3 min video showing the entire system in action. No sales calls required, no pushy tactics. Just watch the video and decide if you want your content to be that this easy, because your next zoom call could be 30 pieces of content, or it could be another lost opportunity. Your choice, Ps. Every day you wait is literally content. Gold sitting in your zoom cloud that could be bringing you clients just saying, Pps, that coach who spent 4 h on content. They're now my client. Last week they posted 47 pieces of content and booked. 6 discovery calls from 2 zoom recordings. This could be you. This post uses psychology triggers like Fomo, social proof transformation stories and clear benefits while maintaining authenticity and addressing the real pain, points online coaches face without content or with content. Creation? No? Well, I was pretty confident that was Those are good posts there, right? And that's how AI works. Right? It wants to be a helpful assistant. There's a if you read the Claude system promise in like 5,000 words or lines, but in there it talks a lot about like how its ultimate goal is to be helpful. If you ever heard of the the clawed, vending machine experiment where it did. Terrible. That's this, because the system prompt is designed to be helpful. So like it thinks it's being helpful here, and it's always going to try to fulfill your request as best it can with what's what it's given right? Because, like. that's the weird thing about AI as smart as these models are. At the end of the day. They're still prediction algorithms and prediction machines, which essentially is what humans are too like that. Our brains are prediction machines like everything that we see and the words on the screen. All this is just light that comes into our eyes and our brain interprets and predicts like what it should be. Right like. We have that blind spot in our eyes so like something in here is, I'm not actually seeing. So we predict stuff, too, you know, no same way, like when you interrupt someone and finish their sentence thinking, like, you know, what they're about to say, like, you're doing the same thing. So let's stop harping on AI about how it does this poorly and figure out how to fix it right, because, like this isn't the worst post ever right, you know, you might think it's written by AI. I don't know. I feel like people kind of like jump the gun and go overboard on that these days. Everything's AI written. but it's not great right? This kind of feels like something a template toddler would have written. You know, those are those copywriters who've just masked template after template over the years and just fill in the blank. It's like, oh, here, put 5 bullets about this and do 5 bullets about that. So all this stuff comes out a little bit too formulaic, and I get it. There's a time and a place for that, especially early on. But the cool thing about AI, and like what's really awesome about AI is you can move beyond templates for your content, and, like kind of go up a chain with prompt templates, which we'll get into that. But I mean, those are essentially Meta and structured prompts that we'll go into, and these allow you to change and input different variables and get way better, more personalized, bespoke content. But still, in whatever framework and structure you like to create content. Right? Like all of them, work to a degree whether you do problem, agitate solution. Very heavy story focused more in your face. So like it doesn't. It doesn't matter what kind of content you want to create like pick something that resonates with you because of the authenticity part is going to matter the most, and you can use AI to help you get to that like we'll be getting into brand kits and design kits later. And this is just like a lot of back information that we will be kind of feeding to the AI. So it knows what to talk about or at least how to talk about the things we want to talk about. I think that's a better way to put it so like, let me take a step back, really quick. And I'm creating this video right now as part of my build in public series where I'm building out my content repurposing system, which, like here's part of it. But essentially it takes a zoom call or any kind of long form. Video turns it into a bunch of different clips, right? So it formats them, finds the best moments. Things like that cuts it from the video. If you ever used opus clips, it's kind of the same thing as that. But just like done programmatically. Then turns each one of those clips in different quotes, Facebook posts, Linkedin posts, emails like whatever you want. and then puts all of that oops wrong. One. Here's some tests I was doing. I just finished putting the auto scheduling part in here. Oh, finish putting the on scheduling part in here. So like we'll be building more of this out. And now what I'm doing is coming back and updating all of my prompts. So I've got this prompt stock here. And what's really cool about the system I built is that any anything that has a copywriter as the job role. It's going to use a clip transcript and create content around that. Right? So I've got what was this one social post quotes is that it? Okay, email brain dump, not using that, the Oprah plant beta, not using that. Yeah. So what I'm gonna be doing is updating these prompts, maybe change them up, doing a few different ones, and likely this will be in part 2 or 3 that we get into some of like the actual, like redoing of these prompts. But I just got all the automation parts up, especially like this auto publishing bit. And now I'm ready to come back and work through oops. That's a creature, the copywriter. This goes to a different post. That does all that. But coming to update those prompts so that I now actually have really cool stuff that I can post. And that's what brings us here. And that's why I'm talking about all this prompt AI conversation stuff. Because I think one of the most important skills that we can start to develop as humans is learning how to talk to AI, because the fact of the matter is, it's only going to become a bigger and bigger part of the world we live in. It is going to be one of the greatest unlocks of prosperity that we have seen. I am a big believer in that. I I don't think there's another way that it can go with how things are right now. And that's a video for another time. But I I am very. very hopeful, very pro AI. I think it's gonna do a lot of cool things, and we can get into all that in another video if people want to hear my thoughts on that. But for now what I can talk really well about is how you talk to these models, because I've had hundreds and hundreds of conversations with them over the last 2 years. I spend 4 h plus a day, you know. I'd say at least 5 to 6 days a week. I spend 4 h plus talking with AI over the last 2 years. So I have have figured out a thing or 2, and that's really the biggest, the biggest thing that I see when people are struggling with using AI is that they just don't know how to talk to it right? Like they'll put in, maybe a prompt like this to get started. And that's it. Right? They'll they'll look at this and be like, Oh, this is whatever I don't like it. It's okay. Take what it is, and it's like. There's so much more. There's so much more that you can do with all this right like this is not even scratching the surface. But what I will say. What I will say is, if you are a brand new coach like you just got into this you know. I don't know. You teach underwater basket weaving. Right? Let's let's say you teach underwater basketball. You have. AI create a post like this. You never done any marketing before. You've just been a social media lurker. You know you want to like. Everybody loves your underwater baskets and think they're so cool. So you start doing as a thing right. Whatever teach other people how to do it. I would post this right if I if I don't know anything about content creation, copywriting, what I'm supposed to do like. I'll read through like reading through this. I'm like, Wow, like it says all the things that like I need it to say. And this actually kind of scared me because it's like I felt like I knew a little bit more than it should, but apparently with the new cloud updates over the last couple days it's instituted. A similar kind of memory feature is Chatgpt. That's 1 of the coolest things about Chat Gpt right now is that it has memory so it can look back at your previous conversations and kind of get to know you and store things about you that you talk about frequently and are important. You know my chat. Gpt knows me very, very well. If you use chat, gpt a lot, ask it to roast you, and don't let it get off with the 1st one. It'll probably be pretty weak, but be like no, no, really roast me. I want you to take the gloves off and just like, go for it. It's funny. It's funny. It's got some good stuff. So a lot of cool things you can do with AI once it has that memory component in there, right? So talking about like a few few of these different things just like, oh, I remember talking about that before, so you can do some cool stuff right off the bat, just saying those things right. You see, it's got a good structure. It adds emojis in there. So it's clear to read. But if you're someone who's been in the online coaching space for a minute, or just kind of done any kind of marketing. You'll very quickly see the holes in this, and how it's pretty generic, and sounds exactly like something a Guru marketing guru or coaching, Guru would like say or put together as like a template post for you to go fill out like being in the industry for a minute. It's just like, Oh, my God! This reeks of like all the things that scream marketing coach, there are a few things I like in there. yeah, this is. This is a really good part. What they're eating. Best test secret. I kind of like that, you know, this lead and Intro is very weak. There's nothing intriguing or exciting about it. And you know, and that's something we're like. AI really fails that kind of out of the box. You have to get a lot of instructions. And tell, you know, like more context, right? That's that's the thing that we'll kind of really be getting into with all this and going back and forth talking a lot about AI writes bad content. Because can I go over a little bit? Oh, wait! Hold on! If any of you guys have a remarkable, that's what I'm using right now. And it's the 1st time I've used it on the computer with color. Oh, that's cool. Right? So lack of context is why AI writes bad content period full stop. That is really what's going on here is you haven't given enough context. It cannot read your mind. so it doesn't know what to put right like. I didn't watch a coach do this last week, you know, and I have no idea what I did last week. But yeah, but because I finally built a fit system, I wish existed when I was growing up like, Yeah, I wish that is true. I wish I had this. This is why I built it out. You know. Here's what most Gurus won't tell you. It's such a typical Guru line. Your content salary happening every single day. It's in your coach. Go like, I like this a lot, right? This is this is a really good good section there, really dropping gold in your zoom, you know, dropping gold. That's kind of cliche. Yeah, this could be useful right? Like, that's while you're stressing, you know, like stressing out what to post tomorrow. It's very common pain point for coaches, content creators, things like that so not bad. We could we could do something better with it? Quick question with every time you hit and mean on zoom, right? So like this is a pretty good section here, right? It could be used better, or we can lead into it a little bit better. Without lifting a finger without hiring a Bia without learning complicated software again like this is very, very, very copy paste, template Guru type. Speak here. Theory, right? That is a very Guru transition. It's cool that like AI is picking up on this stuff. Right? I think, like, take a second to appreciate that just asking it to write a viral Facebook post for online coaches like the little context I gave it. yeah, this is very much structured, like a coaching industry post that I've seen over and over again. Very, very similar frame frameworks. Look, I get it again. Guru transition. Like I said, before, I like. I like this this part a lot. this isn't bad, right? So overall overall. If you've never done this before like post, it like this would be something way better than like a Newbie coach who just like found the industry quit their 9 to 5, you know, whatever. So it's not bad. But we can do a lot a lot better. and you know what. Let's try that once, because I have another thing I'm going to show you. But this could be a fun exercise. Really, quick, if anybody noticed this little thing here, this is whisper flow highly. Highly. Recommend it. It is an awesome software. and just make me a little smaller over here. Boom! Awesome. Whisper flows off software. So you basically can hold hold on your fn key and it will start and then dictate in the mouse, but it uses a little bit of AI to clean up the speech, and actually like writes it out well, because you know how we talk. We'll drop a like and and this thing and that thing we might. There's been times where I've kind of like stumbled over my words like, oh, no, that's not it. And it will actually take that part out and kind of clean up. So it's super cool, highly recommend. You've got a hand. You know a lock feature to where you hit the space bar and just like talk for a while. So if you ever use the built in Mac. Dictation thing. It kind of sucks because, like after a while, just like wig out and stop writing. And also like, I think, it's speech to text capabilities. Aren't that great like AI is real? Or, excuse me, Apple's really shit the bed on AI, which is a topic for another day. But whisper flow is 100% worth in awesome really, big fan. They also have like a a notes feature, too. So you can just like record yourself for a while. So if you use like otter or something like that, this could probably replace it. So what I'm gonna do here is. start the conversation right? Because it's like too many people would take this. and if you're a good marketing, be like, oh, this is garbage. I wouldn't use this blah blah and say, AI sucks, or if you're a Newbie marketer, or like Newbie coach, you'll be like, Oh, this is pretty good. I'll use this. But if we continue the conversation, if we treat AI more like an agency partner or a contractor that we work with you, you wouldn't just like. say this sucks like I'm not going to use it. I'll talk to you next time, right like, if you pay a contractor for content, and you don't like it. What are you? Gonna do you tell them what you don't like? Ask them to redo it. That's what AI is going to do right? The main difference here with AI is one. It's gonna do exactly what you tell it and nothing else. 2 is going to do a lot faster and 3. It's not going to complain or get butt hurt that you want some changes made right. And and I say that as a copywriter who has worked with clients for 10 years and been paid a lot of money to write content. And you know, I've been paid $5,000 to write 5 emails before I get a little butter. Sometimes, if I give something to a client like I don't really like this part I'm like, but I really do right. And at the end of the day it's 1 of those things where, like humans, will always have an ego or bias into it. AI will only have the ego or bias that you give it. So you can kind of train some of these things out of it. And I will show you. Yeah, we'll just show you that right now. So the 1st thing I did is alright. Let's go to the left side. So we got this up, and you see right above that we got. Oh, dang it! Go back! Go back! Go back! I was close one hopefully. You see that. So this is another cloud version, this is my desktop, and you see I have this everyday OS content. Creator, let's go back here. Boom! So this is a Claude project. So anytime I talk to Claude in here, it's going to automatically apply this system prompt. And it's going to have this in its memory. Right? This is my prompt stock. These are all the prompts I'm working with. That showed you right here. We've got my brand kit. which is this. So this gives a bunch of information about the AI that will be changing up a ton and then design Kit. That's not the pretty version. There you go. Here's a pretty version. So got the design kit. And this is basically the brand kit. But for visual stuff, right? And this are basically just very detailed instructions, right? So tells it gives a little bit context, high level, what we're doing. user request. I gotta update this. I don't think this quite works in Claude. I'm not 100% sure, because I'm pretty positive it's not pulling. I don't know. That's part of what we're going to be going over in the next video here. And then just like, if I was working with, you know, junior copywriter, Va, we video editor, whoever you want to give them a series of step-by-step instructions. Right? Analyze the requests, search for matching prompts, select a prompt create a custom, prompt if needed, right. And that's a really cool thing. And why I like using Claude, for this is because it has very good agentic features. Which means, I can, you know, without creating some complicated workflow or automation. Just give it all of my prompts in that prompt doc. Right? So we have. You know, all these prompts in here that we're going to expand out, you know some of these short ones are just for clipping animation and don't really need a prompt. They're just yeah the games that another time but it can go through select a prompt, if no suitable, prompt matches, it will create a custom prompt to go through it right? And figure out the thing based on these structures. transformation, right? So like, oh, this is actually a good thing to to go over. I am a big believer that we, as marketers, coaches, content creators should not be relying on AI to create original content for us. It can help us with the ideation, phase, and all of that. But to have AI write something for you from scratch, I think, is not a very good idea, right? As we were kind of we showed in this. It's not great. And I'll show you why. In a second, even with like some extra stuff, it's still in But what instead we should do is use it to transform our own words. Right? So if you don't know, chat, gpt, the Gpt. Stands for. Oh, my God! I forgot something. General purpose, transformer right keyword, there being transformer, it transforms one thing into another. It transforms your input into what it thinks is the desired output, right? So the reason that AI gets harped on for having this like soulless generic content. That it writes is because you give it soulless generic inputs, right like there's no, there's nothing. There's nothing in this right. There's no soul in this. There's nothing about me in here that you could feel like right if you knew me, and like knew the content. I wrote for myself, read my Facebook page, saw my Instagram videos. Things like that. You would read this and be like that doesn't sound like Fran like that's not. That's not. That's not him at all right. But I didn't give it anything about me. I didn't. But if you start with like here, my system is set up so that it takes where is it? Right? It'll take the transcript from one of these and turns that into into different pieces of content. Right? So it takes my own words and turns into the content. Right? So it has something about me. It knows something about me, and that's what makes AI really cool and powerful, plus then you can just get into like the content multiplication we'll get into that in just a second. So this is the second draft, and you worry about that. you'll see this is a much longer conversation. So I started the conversation. My everyday OS content Creator Project, which has that background? Info about me. That more extensive prompt. And is that how you spell rubric? Hmm! Learn something new every day. So yeah, basically, all I did took this output here. I said, I need you to analyze the attached piece of content that had written by an Llm. And tell me all the ways in which it sucks and needs to be improved, especially as far as the hook and lead go. We need that to be a lot more interesting and just generally make it more on Brand. First, st I need to grade out rubric, then find the ways that we can improve it whoops so no, my gosh. those are. Those are totally relevant for what we're doing here. So don't worry about that So one thing that I think it would be a really good exercise to do if you're just learning about AI, and how to talk to it is come up with some sort of content, grading rubric based on whatever matters to you. Right like. I will work on a prompt that is more of like a specific copy chief that has more instructions on how I want to grade it. But for now, just like, for the example of this. whatever rubric is fine, and I was actually pretty impressed with this as I read through it, because I was much, much nicer to the output from this than this was right like I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good, like much better than I thought it was. Gonna be. I'm like, you know, it's nothing amazing. It's nothing amazing. But I'm like, shit. I'll post it just to see what happens. and then I start re they send through here and start reading this and go grade d plus 38 out of 100. And what that showed me really kind of plainly is like my own biases towards AI. Right like I'm very pro AI is really changed my life in the last 2 years, and helped me in so many ways. I've been struggling with like my copy career. It also is like already taken my job more or less to the point where, like, I've spent the last 2 years learning automation and basic computer programming. So that like, I can create systems like this instead of losing clients to AI. But so what that means because humans always have biases and egos. I wanted to be. And this this is all like, I went. I went through this, live in the last video that I forgot to record. So make sure you hit record creators. And I went through this live. And it really made me realize like, oh, dang like, because I want other people to be as excited about AI as I am. I want to kind of like talk this up more so that people get more excited. And be like, Oh, yeah, that's really not that bad, right? Because we're very influenced. And very influential creatures, right? It's easy for us to like influence and get excited about things like based on what other people say or prior experiences. Blah blah! But when I told AI, tell me all the ways in which this sucks right, and it doesn't care. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't, you know. Like, if I would take this back to a copywriter if a client would like. Come back to me and be like, Hey. not bad. But now I want you to like. Find all the ways, sucks. and like everything that you can do to improve it. I'm like, Oh, my God, really! Are you fucking? Kidding me like no, yeah, it doesn't care. And if I didn't like this like I could have a redo it. You know a lot of times I will change this 1st prompt like 4, 5, 6 times before continuing on the conversation. You know, just taking different things. I've learned from this right? So maybe right like, let's see, what is the rubric we have hook, brand, alignment, content, quality, audience, resonance. Cta, and we can, I mean shit. Let's even just extensive rubric experienced copy. Chief. Let's update and see that. Oh. and while it's doing all this to go back to you know an easy way to learn to use AI or like understand AI better is to do different like grading rubrics. And if you come up with like either rubric that you already use, or, you know, go, look something up and kind of modify that for your purposes, and then kind of feed that into AI with either like content that you've made in the past. you know something you're making right now, and just be like, Hey, analyze this based on the rubric, and tell me which ways it can improve right? And that's a good way to start to understand how AI is looking at your content and thinking about it. and then you can also, too, like you know, there, there are things that I struggle with. Still, right. I've written millions and millions of words, but there's certain things that I don't do well because of how I think about the world, and having an AI rubric in here kind of great, and be like making sure like, Hey, is this hook actually interesting, right? Like, will this be interesting to everybody else, or just to me? So stuff like that. So let's see, we'll go through Go through here content, analysis, custom, analysis, framework, right? And that could be something. Here, let's do this. Please give me the full and complete, detailed, prompt. that you came up with slash created to do this rubric grading analysis that screwed up one to do. Oh, there we go! Whisper, whisper, flow has been weird about stopping. So we'll do that while we go through here. So great d plus all right detail, rubric assessment hook and lead 5 out of 20 generic. I just watched opening, tired, overused fake relatability play with the scream Emoji 0 pattern, interrupt or curiosity. App takes 4 paragraphs to get to any value, like no unique angle or fresh perspective like this harsh stuff. Right? Could you imagine sitting here and having someone like grade your work like this brand alignment. 3 out of 20. Vital didn't know anything about my brand. So of course, like. it's not going to like, it's going to fail this like horrifically but it just kind of goes to show that like, if you write a piece of content and you have a brand kit with it like you can include that in your your content, like, you know. Like, if you're a freelancer. write copy for clients like Create brand kit for a client, and then use AI to make sure that whatever you write for them like follows like on brand right? So missing all this, which no kidding structure and flow 8 out of 15 uses. Line breaks and format. That's that's a bit, but must have right. Must have done it well. Wall of text and nice sections. No, but therefore transition as required, that's part of my brand. So I highly recommend looking into the careers of South Park. They've got a great little video on Youtube like called Story Structure. You know, it's just Youtube, like, how like South Park story structure or something like that, my Youtube's blocked right now because it's gonna focus But they have this great, this great philosophy that if you can say, and then between different beats of a story. You know, different section scenes of a story you've got a pretty boring story it should be filled with, but and therefore right. So it's like. I spent the entire week coming up with all these prompts that I thought was going to help have AI create the best content for me. But after I saw the 1st thing it put out. I just wanted to walk away from this whole thing. I I don't know like that was, that was not a good thing, but you get the idea, the the but is to kind of something needs to happen right? Like we. We have to. We have to make sure that there, there's something happening that is interesting and and interesting things are those that get in the way of what we think. The obvious outcome should be right like if I'm starting to a conversation of like, Oh, my God, I love AI. I've spent all this time creating these prompts, and you know, really poured my heart and soul into it. Been working on prompt engineering and stuff like that for a while. But you're like, Oh, my God, what happened right? That's kind of what it is. Value delivery all sizzle. No steak doesn't teach anything right. I'm a big believer in teaching. First, st you know. You give value that way. No frameworks, prompts or actionable tactics list benefits clearly doesn't demonstrate expertise just claims it. That's a big thing that's kind of included in my brain. Kids like show. Don't tell psychological triggers. Fomo is present. Social proof attempt, though generic. right? Fake scarcity, only 10 coaches. This is the one I'd like push back on a little bit. simply because, like the way I run this like I, I'm working with clients on their prompts a lot. So I do. Do limit it. Pushy cta! Despite claiming no pushy tactics. Let me see here, what is the Cta. Let's see if you're done with, and you're ready for I mean I don't know if I'd call it called this pushy so it might be a little little over the top on that one, but still right like, if we can prove it, we can prove it. Originally it could be written by any automation service cookie, cutter, coach marking template, drop seriously in 2025 right Ps. Structure is painfully predictable. Credibility. 5 out of 10 fake claims without specifics. Last week story feels manufactured right totally is numbers, provided no mention of actual tech process. real truth. What sucks the most right like. even if you had like an editor, you know you're working working at bigger copy place, or you know, you hire a copy coach like it's often hard for people to give this sort of like direct feedback. And personally, like, I like direct feedback like this, right? Like, I don't need things sugarcoat like. Just tell me what's wrong, and like we can start to fix it like, is it gonna hurt? I'm gonna feel a little upset about it. Yes, but I'm a big boy. I'll get over it so like. I want it to talk to me like this. And if I you know when I spend time creating a more detailed rubric. then it will have even more clear instructions on how to do this. So like, let's just go over what we got here. What sucks the most. The opening is doa. I just watched a coach spend 4 h. This is the. It was a dark and stormy night of marketing copy. Every coach automation tool starts with a you're immediately forgettable. Right? And this is a good reminder. Right? This is a good reminder. I just watched, you know, like you are forgettable. And you need to know that emoji diarrhea. I like this. Your brand, Kit says sparingly. This post has 15 plus emojis. It looks like a 2019 Mlm. Pitch AI is starting to get funny. The fake, reluctant Guru voice. Here's the truth. Most Gurus won't tell you while writing exactly like every Guru, the irony is painful. Oh, this is good, this is really good, right? And and again, like this is without much context of like a rubric. I just like an extensive rubric and experienced copy chief or editor would use right? 0 demonstration of expertise. You claim to be tech savvy, but never mentioned what Amls use, how automation actually works specific tools or workflows any technical insight whatsoever. Right? And this is good feedback but also not exactly accurate. And this comes back to the context of like. what demonstration of expertise means in this context? Right? Because coaches probably don't care that much about what AI model I use. How the automation actually works like, no one wants me to come in and start explaining what all these different nodes do right? Like I. All this stuff. And a lot of this. And a lot of this is just Bs stuff that you don't need to know. It's like prep stuff, right? It's this, make sure that we have the files we need. Right? This, make sure we have the context. We need looks for clips. This one formats it right, then brings it back through here to edit again, then formats it again. Then to, you know, so like all this, all this stuff that you don't no one cares about right. But what we do want to demonstrate and show of expertise, you know, would be more along the lines of that. We understand how to leverage AI to fill those content gaps that most coaches, you know, are falling into right, whether you don't have the extra budget to hire a big content team that can edit all your videos. Right? You know. So like most coaches, likely can hire an editor that might edit what one video a week, 2 videos a week, something like that. Not 10. Right? But AI, let's do 10 videos a week. Let's do every single video. For you know, fraction of the price. So showing how you can take AI use different prompts things like that to really leverage your content output and test a bunch of different things like that's how I would talk about like demonstrating expertise generic benefits list. Very true, the fair warning section. This might feel like cheating cringe. This is 2015 copywriting. Fake scarcity. Again, I would. Your brand is about democratizing. AI, not false exclusivity. Okay, this is a really great point. Right? So I would, you know, like I I would push back on this for sure. Still. because I do think 10 is real and legitimate, you know, onboarding more than 10 people with the system right now. It does still take a minute to set up, and you know it is an ongoing thing at the moment to keep improving, and stuff like that. So like I would do, I would say 10 is good, but it brings up a good point. Your brand is about democratizing AI, not false exclusivity. So that would tell me what I should be doing in that line is a better job of explaining why there are only 10 spots available which can also help boost credibility and likelihood of someone saying, Yes, because, you know, the reason is is that I give more time and attention. To people. And that's another cool thing about like AI, and what it will allow us to do, as far as like making money. I don't like managing people. I've done it both in retail settings like face to face. And for different, like online companies I've worked with. And I just don't like managing people period. I don't want to manage people. I want to do as much as I can as a sole entrepreneur, which obviously means that there will be caps in what I can do. Income! I can make things like that. But at the end of the day I'm not willing to make those sacrifices in quality and customer service that you know you just have to, as you scale and hire other people and do stuff like that's not something I want to do like. I want to be in the trenches like building things, working on clients stuff and make it better and better. Right? I love. I love writing. I love writing, and I love being able to produce cool content. more, better, faster with AI. So that's what I want to do. And this is very real. This is very real right now, and 10 people in the next month here. So I need to just give it some more context how to fix this mess. All right. new hook options. Let's see option. A technical entry. Yesterday I fed a 47 min zoom recording to Gpt. 4 with a 2. I mean, that's like super specific. What happened next broke my content calendar in the best way. Right? So if I was making content more, maybe for like automation people right like, if my goal was to sell this like specifically to like other automation. people who just want like a plug and play system that they can learn how to install for clients like I might. I might go with this one option B. Contrarian data coaches who post daily make 40% less than coaches, who post twice a week unless they're using this one prompt system that I I don't like that one. That one just sounds stupid like if you post more like, you're probably going to do better than someone who posts twice a week. So AI doesn't always get it. Story with specifics. France just turned one zoom call into force and piece content, using 3 chat gpt prompts and a Google sheet time invested 8 min. Here's the exact workflow again. Not that great. It's funny. I actually got a lot better responses from the last, the last one which I'll show you in a second. Alright we got for voice fixes. Now kill every emoji yup and technical specifics maybe release one actual, prompt or framework. It's actually not a terrible idea. It's actually not a terrible idea. Maybe what I do is like link to I don't know like I could. If you know, if I want to go like the extra mile I could link to like a meta prompt so that people can like create their own brand. Kit. Kind of thing, reference, and atlas a bit subtly. These are. I have some characters like I'm playing with. I need to redo this because I don't quite like the characters as they are. But I like the idea of having characters in my content. You sure paragraphs? Yup. Current ones are novels, I mean, are they really alright. I guess. Depending. Yeah, I mean, like, if you consider all this like one paragraph and social media, right? structure, overhaul. Yep, yep, get value in 51st words show the system, don't just promise it. Include a mini tutorial, prompt. Make a Cta about learning, not buying brand align reframe instead of coach struggling with content position as explored, discovering untapped content. Gold in their zoom. Vault fits your adventure theme. Perfectly right. So here's here's something that's like kind of really worth mentioning like, why gain your brand kit? Right? Is important. I don't think this is something. Wait! What's that like? I am not like Brand was never a big thing for me, most of my career. It's only been the last couple of years that I've really started to be like. Oh, damn! I really kind of screwed that one up, not building more of a brand But here, like explore discovering untapped content and gold in their zoom vault fits your adventure theme perfectly. That was my 1st idea of what I want to do for my brand kit and my brand, and what I've kind of been playing with like. Here, let's see, right? So it creates stuff like this. I would say. This is probably my favorite of all of them. Right. I have a few different themes. I wanted to try try out a few different things, so like I've been playing with what I want for brand stuff quite a bit. And now I just need to come back and kind of like solidify it. But, like overall, I've not been totally digging these characters. so we'll go back through and fix it. And that's the cool thing with AI, too. Right? Like, I can create multiple different brands. And that's actually like, kind of what I'm going to be doing with another series is creating just new brand accounts of I don't know different topics and things like that, and start creating content and growing those channels just for shits and giggles and proof of concept And I don't. I don't want to do the explore discovering untapped content, golden or zoom vaults, like as I read, I'm like, that sounds kind of cringey. We're gonna have to give some different details there. Bottom line. This reads like every coach to coach pitch from 2020. Your brain is about pragmatic tech, savvy empowerment with playful challenger voice. This post is neither pragmatic nor playful playful. It's just pushy. Start over with your actual expertise, the technical how to that. Others won't share. Right. So we're gonna go back to the other conversation in just a second. But I do want to kind of show you how Claude, being such a good agentic model, and, if you remember, from here we had search for matching prompts, select a prompt create, a custom, prompt if needed. and then execute, execute the transformation right? And if we look, this prompt a lot longer than I thought is very clearly not not in here. You are, bell hardened copy, chief, with 25 years experience. Right? Let's see. Oh, Video, blueprint builder. So we've got copy chief here. But that's as far as like videos go. What's right now, that's the Xml version. Yeah. So I mean, like, we don't have this prompt in here, this created this create, this prompt and basically use it. What was it? This exact specific, prompt? It used when it came up with this 1st one? I don't know if we look through here. let's see from the brand kit, right? So like pulled stuff from the brand Kit key issues, I'm already seeing generic Guru, right? So it's not following this like specific brand below. And that's why, again, it's important to use prompts. But if if I want, if I really like this, want to use this for other content. now I have the prompt right? I have version one of this. I can look through it. And anything that like, you know. Let's see hook and lead 20 points values 1st 3 seconds. you know, I might change this from 3 seconds to 3 sentences. Right? Since it'll have a better idea of like a sentence versus the seconds. Here pattern interrupt. Is it unexpected, fresh, right? I would probably like detail this out more and be like, what does unexpected fresh mean in the context of, you know. coaching online education, Curia Gap. What question does it create, you know, might give some examples here. Things like that. So this gives you a really really good place to start. and you can keep working from there. And now this is the 1st one, right? And this is pretty similar. I actually liked. I like this rubric better than the second one generic. I watch someone waste time openings your intrigue. You don't really need to go. Oh, this is good, right? Some valid points identified, benefits clearly listed, though generic logical flow exists. But during cliches and emoji spam blah blah critical issues, right? This. This focused a little bit better on the hook and opening and gave me some different suggestions this way. Right? So redemption path rather than creating a a whole new post right away. This focus, like I said on the hooks. Better option. One parent interrupt your zoom. Recurrents are worth $47,000. You just don't know it yet. This could be good if it was true, right? It obviously took it from the original post which is assumed to be true. But I don't. I don't have anything to back up the $47,000 yet. I could take this as painting kind of a scenario or situation showing how. You know either a case study about how a client made more money, and you know, updated to the appropriate number. Another way is just like painting a picture of like, Hey, this is how like your zoom recordings have all this extra content. If you post more content, you're gonna probably get more clients, you know, like extrapolate your current. kpis Roi's from your content now and like, let's say, that holds. But you start producing 10 times the amount of content, you know, like you go route like routes like that. I like this one last Tuesday bit, analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot does it now? Right? That's kind of a nice fun. But therefore, type of thing, it's not a true but it does, however, have that kind of contrast there. It's like, oh, I create an automation content automation system. But I'm done creating content forever. Like, what? What do you mean? So I might excuse me, you know. Maybe something changed changing this or adding to it where it'd be like. Last Tuesday, after finishing my content automation system and having bit analyzed my coaching calls, found something that made me quit creating content forever. I don't know something like that. And that's something I'll come back to in just a second after we go through option. 3. The Contrarian tooth. I like this one a lot. This is very much more me and my style, and like how I like to talk and talk to people. Stop creating content seriously. Stop what your conversations do instead. So it gives some good stuff, right? And again, this is all based on my brand kit, and if I don't like this you know, I can add stuff to my brand kit to get to get closer. I want just like, if I was working with contractor Va employee agency each time that we go through and create new content, you know, like they're updating their files. And you're like, Okay, we like this. We don't like that like this. Don't like that. Do the same thing with AI. See, Brand align, we don't really well. don't really need to go through all this stuff. Kind of similar to the last one with the critiques. But you know, just start with impossible sign claim use. But therefore, Max, 3 sentences per sections your decorative language. Oh, these were funny challenge. Don't coddle. You're either automating or you're cosplaying as va like this actually made me laugh out loud the 1st time. I don't know if y'all find it funny. But I do. I'm trying to get AI to put a little more humor into it. Your competitors use system. You use hope, it's a little bit too, on the nose. Every manual post is a choice to stay small. That one's kind of funny, too. Like if you could work that in a little bit differently, I think that could could be a funny. A funny thing I feel like this would be. Hmm! You would almost like I could see this being fun as like a parody of like a bro marketing thing, you know, like. have a guy pretending to be like super Bro and buff, be like every manual post, is a choice to stay small. You know, kind of like one of those bodybuilder type things anyways. So this we're just gonna kind of like, totally skip over. It it my part of my direction. The brand kit is like. I like to keep things concise. Economy of words, you know. Don't use fluff stuff like that, and I should specify this out a bit more. because I don't want, you know, like is too short. Right? It's it's interpreting what I meant by concise incorrectly, and again, like as I was kind of looking through my brand kit, I'm not 100% sure where, how or what is causing it to do that in here ruthless edits probably would be part of it. Pragmatic. Yeah, I think you know some of those some of those might do it. But and also, too, like I didn't want a paragraph post right? It just didn't know from the 1st conversation over here where I asked for the long form specifically right. It's telling me here's a compelling long form, but this doesn't know that I wanted long form. It just knows I got a long form. So it's like, Oh, we should shorten this next steps. Here's some of the rewrites, I'm like, okay, sure fine, but that's not exactly it. And what I like to do. And this has been a complete game changer with whisper, whisper, flow, now is you just start the conversation right? So, you know, do the fn and spacebar. and go back through this prompt and just talk through what I like, what I don't like what I agree with, what I disagree with anything I want changed stuff like that. right? And look at this. Look at this context like this was just for me talking, you know, and imagine, like most people just like typing this out aren't going to type this much, just, you know, simply because, like it's take a while, takes a minute but instead, like, I can just talk through all this and just be like I like this part. I don't like that part. This is kind of what I'm going for. Blah blah blah! And then and then a little little hack little secret that I love to use and finish off a lot of my prompts with is. ask me any follow-up questions. Come on. ask me any. Follow up questions you need to in order to be 90% confident, you can make the necessary updates to really make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like this for them. So the important part is, ask me questions until you're 90% confident you can effect. Can dot dot right? don't go above 90 do like 80% if you want to. But like 80, 90% is good, anything above 90, it just gets like too detailed. So what you're basically saying here is like, what contacts are you missing that you need to create the post I want? And if you gave it like some decent input before and tell you like, what your goal is, what you're trying to do things like that. And we'll get more into this into like conversation structure in the next video. But what it's what we're doing here is asking like, what other details do you need to know what are the things you know about me. To make this really good. And you can simply say, like to effectively, you know, 90% confident to effectively help me create this or finish this task, finish this project whatever like. I like being a little bit more explicit in these things because it does help kind of guide the AI and like what to think about right? Like 90% confident you can make the necessary updates to make. And I should take really out of there. But who cares to make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like that for them? Right. The ultimate goal that I want is an effective Facebook post that will help people have people reaching out to me. Right? So what do you need to know to be 90% confident that you can do that. Create that Facebook post. And it will ask right? It's not going to groan. It's not going to be like, oh, my God! You want me to rewrite it again, or do this again. So it was great feedback. I need to figure out like, well, I don't know this kind of feels nice, but you know, these being a helpful assistant, they can be a bit sycophantic. And will usually tell you. That's good, right? Otherwise. So you do have to take a bit of critical thinking and make sure it's actually right and not just blowing smoke up your ass. It's really important to do like, I don't recommend using AI to create content around subjects that you aren't familiar with, because it will do a really really good job writing something that is complete, 100% bullshit, or just like off the mark of what's kind of like, accurate and true. It'll sound really good and like, if you don't know, like the industry like, yeah, that that totally makes sense. But then you hand it to the client. They're like the this isn't right. You're like fuck. So just make sure that, like you do know what you're talking about. Before you have AI do it so you can proofread in that And then what I did in the last video that I didn't record is essentially took whisper flow like I talked about before. started it, and just read through these and just kind of answered the questions right and talk through this. You mentioned your accomplishments, writing 10 million words, any specific client transformations, your own content, metrics. real systems, metrics. Right? We don't need to go into this at the moment. It's probably a little bit too in depth, on, like how I think about things. But what you can see and what is important to point out here is because I use whisper, flow. Look at these answers right? Like this is a lot of context that I'm giving it and able to give it super easily, because all I did was start it. And then, just, you know, like, read through and brain dumped. Yeah, I'm like, no, this isn't right. I'd like this to do this instead. Blah blah. So it gives all that. And I haven't actually read the updated version yet. So let's we'll go through that together and see what what we come up with. So here we go 1st off quick, naming suggestions so like one of the things I did want to use, because, like, I don't want to do sales calls initially, or frame them as sales calls and don't I excuse me. I want to instead do it as a like brand Kit design type call where we help build out like their brand kit design kit. and then a minute, prompt that people can use and try it out and create content for them, and then have the sales call kind of thing. So ask for some naming ideas. I don't like voice mining call, but I do like content. DNA session. That's kind of a good one. The mining like. I don't know how I could get content. DNA mining I don't know but content set DNA session sounds pretty good. We can run with that version. One wake up, call level 10 sas, alright. Let's see. Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too. Really, quickly is tone calibration. I would definitely say, like my true authentic energy, is the 10 full. Wake up. You're doing everything wrong. Type of thing. I can be very to the point. and blunt in that respect with a bit of disregard, for like social norms, social conventions. And you know it's 1 of those things where. when you're creating content, you know I know the the trope is like, be authentic, be authentic and like yes, absolutely. But like, how authentic do you need to be in that like. I have a whole life outside of, like what I do here, and what I post that I don't talk about just because it's a not relevant and be like, not things that like I want to talk about right? Is that like inauthentic? I'm not sharing my entire life. I don't know, maybe, but you don't need to know that stuff right there. There is a specific business purpose. That I am creating this content for like, yes, I am trying to help people. So I do want to make sure that, like it catches their attention in a way that makes them open to receiving my ideas rather than just like shove in your face. You're doing wrong right? So we'll see what this full wake up. You're doing everything wrong, energy is. And then the other one I asked for like something that's more in like the 5 to 6 range, like a little. It's balanced, but it's just like a little tip towards towards the Sas here. So I'm curious to see what it does in that respect. you know, and kind of how it compares right? And that comes back to like your own, like understanding your own personal, like biases, flaws, worldviews and things like that. It's like knowing the ways in which you think about, and present yourself to the world that might not be effective, helpful, or beneficial to your bigger goals, you know, whether, again, like could be creating. You know, some sort of dollar value that you're looking for. It could be an impact. It could be a freedom, you know. That's the thing, I think, is really awesome about AI is more and more. People will have the ability to create lifestyle businesses. Right? You know, we, I think we're going to see kind of an end to the make millions of dollars in 90 day. Yeah, we're we're already seeing a lot of that like make money online stuff fizzle out. But I think it's going to come back even more. To the point where you will see a lot more people, you know, making just average income online, creating content about specific topics or things that they're interested account interested. On different accounts. Right? So we'll see more of that in the future. And where's I going with that one? I don't know. But oh, the the business purpose right? So like. Let's see what level 10 sas gets us. And if that's a little bit too over the top. So version one. oh. yeah, we'll get into this. We'll get this. I'll come back to that second stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do it instead. Because right now you're cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running systems, and every manual post you create is a choice to stay small. harsh, good. Someone needs to say it. Last Tuesday bit analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot army handles it. Now. here's what bit discovered. You're performing the same conversation 5 times a week and creating 0 content from it. Meanwhile you're staring at Canva at 11 Pm. Trying to remember what font you used last time, Atlas, nearly short, circuited when he mapped out the ways. Think about it. Monday. Strategy session with a client gone. Tuesday group coaching masterclass, deleted Wednesday sales call where you drop your best framework banished. Thursday. Interview, where you explained your entire methodology. Poof! Friday workshop, where every set everyone said, mind blowing dust. 3 min of pure gold. 0 content cried. But you'll spend your weekend batching content. Aka! Panic cream, mediocre posts. I like that. You're either automating or you're larping as your own intern huh! Choose. I like that part a lot. I do like that. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice. Every zoom call you do contains 12 to 15 story loops. Android chaperone will weep with joy. 8 to 10 contrarian insights. Your audience needs 20 quotable moments that would stop scrolls 3 to 5. Complete teaching frameworks. Enough email sequences to nurture leads for month within 1 h of hitting end meeting bidden Atlas can extract all of it. Bitmaps, narrative structure, atlas, cuts, formats, and deploys. You go have lunch. But Francis AI. Content is garbage. You're right. Those write viral posts with AI tools, absolute trash. I've tested them all. They pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration porn that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune cookie. I like this a lot. I don't know if you all think this is funny, but I am. I'm a fan. that's not what this is. Here's what separates this from every other AI content scam. I spent 10 years running over 10 million words that generated 10 million dollars in revenue for clients, real campaigns, real business, real money. I know it converts. And what's just noise. So I build your custom prompts. They're not templates. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. I like this. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. We spend a session extracting your content. DNA. I build custom brand kits, design kits, and prompts your system, learns your frameworks, your language, your edge, then every one to 2 weeks we refine it together, because good enough is the enemy of extraordinary. The coaches who get this are already ahead. While you're finding your voice. They're everywhere. While you're planning content. They're closing deals while you're building consistency. They've already won. not because they're better coaches because they realize coaching calls are content. Creation, truth bomb. So this is like, well, all right. I'll come back to that. I so I want to read through all this before I start critiquing. It's really hard, though. Truth bomb. I built this system because I spent 4 years watching brilliant coaches fail, not because they couldn't coach, because they couldn't market, and I was tired of seeing mediocre coaches with great marketing eat their lunch. The world needs more good coaches, not more good marketers. So I built the bridge, upload your zoom, call, walk away, come back to 6 weeks of content, fair warning. I only take 10 clients per month. not fake scarcity, real bandwidth limits. Each client gets custom prompts personal refinement sessions, and my decade of experience baked into their system. That takes time. I refuse to dilute the quality. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out. We do a content. DNA session, not a sales call. I build your custom system during our call. You watch your own words become 30 pieces of content. You decide. If you want this power permanently. the session alone will change. How you think about content forever. You have 2 choices. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep falling behind. Keep watching others dominate your space. or let your conversations become your content. Empire DM me with, done with manual right now I'll send you examples of what bidden Atlas created from a single 37 min call your next zoom call is either tomorrow's content or tomorrow's regret. You decide Francis Ps. Still manually creating content in 2024. That's like handwriting, hand washing clothes when you own a washing machine, except the washing machine, also folds organized and delivers everything to your closet while you sleep. Alright. Alright! Alright! You know, as far as the Sas goes, and don't think that was too over the top, like. I don't think anything in there was really going to like turn someone off or piss them off. so I'm not sure how I feel about that. We'll see what version? 2 firm but fair level 5 to 6 sounds like. And then once I'm done reading this. We'll go back and talk about how I'd kind of critique and edit from here, because, like, I don't, these are not production ready yet. And and we want to get through these. And because right now, what I'm trying to do is show you that AI can write some pretty good content like this. It's still going to always sound a little bit off, because, like it's not quite your own words. But, as you can see. I'm putting a lot of my own stuff in here. And as I've been kind of like talking through this I've told them, like little bits about me and that's where it knows, what I say, oh, I talked about this. In there. Well, actually, I said, those vite I, mentioned the the right viral posts, like social media scheduling tools. This they came out with this on its own like that was pretty good stuff. But this is definitely much more in line in line with me although not quite there yet. Version 2 firm but fair level 5 and 6. Stop creating content. Wait, hear me out, let your conversations do instead. Last week bit analyzed my coaching calls, and discovered something that completely changed. How I think about content. Bit bit's my AI co-pilot. Atlas is the one who does the heavy lifting they're about to become your favorite team. Here's what we found. The average coach is 5 to 10 conversations per week that could become 200 plus pieces of content. Instead, those conversations disappear into the zoom cloud while you stress about what to post tomorrow. Sound familiar. I get it. I really do. For 10 years I've been the behind the scenes writer creating content systems for coaches, 10 million words written 10 million plus in revenue generated and hundreds of campaigns launched. and you know what killed me. watching brilliant coaches struggle with content while mediocre ones dominate the space, the difference systems. Here's the uncomfortable truth. your best content already exists. It's in your coaching, calls, your strategy sessions, your masterclasses, your workshops. Every single conversation contains complete story arcs that would make Andre chaperone, proud, quotable insights. Your audience desperately needs teaching frameworks. You don't even realize you're sharing email sequences, hiding your explanations. Social posts scattered throughout your sentences within 1 h of ending your zoom call. All this could be extracted, formatted, and ready to post. But AI content sucks. You're absolutely right, those generic right viral post tools. They're why, everyone sounds the same. It's exactly why I built something different. And here's how this actually works. Instead of templates, you get custom prompts built specifically for your voice. You start with a content DNA session, where I learn your unique frameworks, your communication style, your brand personality, your audience's languages. Then build custom, brand kits, design kits and prompts. Capture your essence, not generic. AI, slop your actual voice, automate, and here's the kicker every one to 2 weeks. We were fine together, and I know, like, I'm really not liking this very much. But I'm reading this all the way through for 2 reasons. One, it's super important to read your copy out loud, to hear how it sounds, but also to like there might be like one or 2 nuggets in here that I really like that I can use. Right? I I like this part. you know, this is, this is decent, like, we can do something with this. But like, for the most part, I'm just not. Yeah. I like the 10 better. Not generic. AI slop. Your actual voice automated. Here's the kicker everyone fine together because your voice evolves, your message sharpens your system. Should, too. This one. This is good math is simple. We did that. Why I built this. I spent years managing content teams for coaches. I hate it managing people, coordinating schedules, chasing deadlines. It was everything I didn't want to do. I just wanted to create great content. That converts. I built a system that came up. Excuse me. So I built a system that could handle 89% of the heavy lifting. Now, one person can manage what used to take a team and coaches can focus on coaching instead of content. Creation. Here's the thing. The coaches succeeding right now are better than you. They just show up more consistently while you're playing content. They're posting content while you're finding your voice. They're amplifying theirs while you're learning canva. They're closing clients. The gap isn't talent. It's systems. I can only take 10 new clients this month. This isn't fake scarcity. It's real bandwidth. Each client gets custom prompt, developed, personal onboarding, bi-weekly refinement sessions by decade of experience. Quality takes time or is refuse to compromise on that what happens next? You reach out with ready for systems. We schedule a content DNA system. I build your custom system during the call, no pressure sales zeros, right? So I'm just gonna skip the rest of that because kind of yeah, I just I like, I like the Sas version better for sure but still not quite there yet. So we're just going to go from here right? So like this part. I feel it's less funny than when I read it the 1st time. I think that's because it's trying to jam it together. So like the 1st thing I'm gonna do is copy this. I don't really like that section as much as I did in your rubric or grading. I feel like it kind of falls a little bit flat when you scrunch it all together. I think having something earlier on about cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running system. Well, I don't like the competitors. Running systems part. The cosplaying Va is really good. And then, later on, you had something about oh. the intern thing, and I forgot where it was. But, like I I like that, I think, combining those together early on could be a nice little comedic relief and humorous bit to get into the content right away and pull people in. So what if we drop the every manual post you create as a choice to say small and like. Try to use that somewhere later in the post and focus this once, like on the cause playing with like the Va intern stuff, because I think that could be a lot funnier. Oh, oh. shoot so I didn't have like the text box. Oh, it's control command. B. There we go alright. And then so this is all I'm gonna do. As I go through here is just say like what I like and don't, and how I want to finish it. I'm not gonna pause and actually go through this like and talk you guys so you can hear how I like go through this and think about this rather than just do, and then be like, Oh, here, here's the output. Because that's not helpful. I'm not really liking the integration of bit and atlas into this right it it seems a bit jarring and confusing of like, Who's this bit person analyzing the coaching calls? And who's this Atlas person structuring together? So I think maybe we should just drop that all together for this and just not use the characters at all. What else I do like the stern at Canva 11 pm. Reference. That's pretty solid. I also really like the think about it. Section the Monday, Tuesday, fri. Through Friday, like those those really good I think we should keep those and then oh, here we there's the larping as your own intern. I think that's really good to alright. I didn't mean to say that in there I just got excited when I found it all right. Should keep those The. Here's what's actually insane. Part is pretty solid, too. We can keep that again like dropping the bitten Atlas can extract all that I think it would be beneficial to just say something along the lines of as soon as your zoom call is done processing you know we leverage AI and automations to analyze the transcript for the best moments, using code. Something like that, you know. We turn that long form into clips right away and then iterate over each clip to create. I don't know. Post something like that. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for there, but I do like the idea of like the the AI, you know, bit. Does this Atlas does that? You go have lunch? But again dropping like bit and atlas, and just having some sort of like AI is doing this thing while you're off living your life and right. And that's 1 thing that I really kind of like want to touch on what I think is so exciting about AI, and everybody is like freaked out like AI is gonna take our jobs like, yes, good, please, please, like I don't. The more AI can do this. The more that I can like help. Other people like create better content for themselves right? Because, like writing good content. like, actually, right as a human like takes time, takes energy, lots of brain power and stuff like that. And it's also difficult, because, like, I don't actually know what my clients thinking, like, all I can go on is the conversations I've had and the things that they've shared with me, and I might have not asked the right questions like I do a pretty good job, and I try my best and things like that. But I don't always ask the right things. But if it's you writing the content for yourself, having a conversation with an AI, you know that that thing will spark or like. It'll ask a question like, Oh, that story right? Which might might not have been a story that you even thought about before. So there's a lot of benefits to being able to like. Do all this more yourself. And the AI is making that happen right like, especially in the copywriting. Field content creation field. It's taking those jobs. And it's going to keep taking people's jobs. And it's going to be starting with like those mundane move, data from one software to another. this, that and the other thing copy paste kind of stuff like a lot of Admin tasks. Things like that are going to be eaten up really quickly. and we're going to be freed up to do like cooler, better things, right like, instead of thinking like, Oh, my God, you know, executive assistant like you're gonna fire them because of AI. It's like, no like they're going to. Now have an AI tool that has all of your conversations that you've been having with clients, them team, whatever that they can infinitely query to help them come up with plans, ideas, executions for the stuff that you want to happen right? So it's going to give them more power to do their job faster and better like. That's what we're getting into. So back to it. Ai content is garbage right? Those red error. I really like the pull on. I really like the viral post tool section that's really good. I think. kind of putting ourselves against those works really well, because there are like dozens of right viral content software out there. But the they pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration poem that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune. Cookie is absolutely fire. I love that I like and want to have more lines like that throughout the content. Let's see. Alright. So let's see this next part here. Oh. so I like this start of the here's what separates this from every other. AI content scam section. But what I do want to kind of get into a little bit more of like what it is, what they're getting kind of thing, because it's not quite accurate right now. What? Oh, what? So what this is more about is like, we're gonna have the content DNA call. And that's designed to get the custom brand Kit design Kit. And then Meta prompt so they can create their own content. But that's more of like a free lead magnet kind of thing, like a way to give value 1st and like show proof, this works. We're not building their system or anything on the call. They're not getting anything like done on the caller like that point of this is to get them the prompts that they can use and start putting it like chat to your cloud right now and create content, but also to like. I am going to give them some clips and some example posts created by the system, just to show them like what's possible. Using this system. And you know, I do like the the one part of like you get to decide if this is something you want permanently, right? So like, basically, what we're gonna be doing is going over their business, who they are, what they're doing, what their offer is stuff like that to build out the brand and design Kit, I'm going to turn that call into a few clips for them for examples, and then go over that with them, and then, at the very least. They're going to have the brand Kit design Kit and the Meta prompt that they can use with just like a regular chat Gpt or Claude session and make whatever kind of content that they want manually that way. And it's just something. If they want help with the automation part of it, then we can talk about using my system. Let's see anything else. I really do like the section under the coaches who get ahead. Get this already ahead, like while you're finding your voice while you're playing content while you're building consistency. I like those. those are really solid. I do want you to drop the thing like truth. Bomb fair warning. That's a little bit like, too, on the nose for me. I'm much bigger fan of the 2 plus 2, and let them figure out it's 4 method, right? that's where it goes in the show and not tell like no one likes being told. But we do want to tell them and give them kind of the right ingredients for them to come to the conclusion that we want type of thing. Oh, my God! Need to remember to keep that on there. Okay, what else? Oh. I don't want to mention anything about like come back to 6 weeks of content like, I don't want to put the week thing in there, simply because, like a who are we to decide like how much content someone posts. And then the other thing, too, is like depending on how we set up these prompts. It might only be a day or 2 days, or a couple days worth of content. It just might be that we have custom stuff for each platform, like really kind of depends on the client and how much content they want to put out. Like, for example, I plan to do long form videos, multiple times a week and create a bunch of clips and content from that. And you know, ideally, you know, post a ton of clips from each of those where, like one of those videos might be like 2 or 3 days worth of content, only type of thing. So I don't want to say 6 weeks worth of content, because then that also seems like overwhelming. It's like, oh, well, then, what do I? What do I need this for? Like I'm just gonna like, fill up with so much content, so quickly like, so again, this is more for giving them like a bunch of content. That they can put out everywhere and just make sure that they're getting exposure, because, like the one thing that we can know for certain is that if you put out more content, more people are going to see your content right if if every video you get gets 200 views and you put out one video a day, that's 200 views. But if you put out 5 videos a day that now becomes a thousand views right? And you can easily just start to multiply the views you get by putting out more content. Even if you're not necessarily growing right away, because there is like a certain amount of consistency and timing that you need to like. put on these platforms to build up an audience didn't mean to send in that last part. That was kind of just the conversation to that's supposed to be for us, but we'll see what we'll see what it does with that. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out here 2 choices. I'm not too happy with the ending with, like the 2 choices. Type of thing. It it falls a little flat. 1st off like I'm not. Gonna send them a example of another call like that seems pointless like when we're gonna do like a call together. And they're gonna have like specific content for them. Right? Like, why would I want to see a generic example of someone else. When I can get one. That's for me. Right? So let's drop that part. Also, it's 2025, not 2024. I like the the hand washing clothes, analogy type thing. And then how you also do like folds, organizes, delivers. Could we find a different but similar analogy that might be like a little bit more ridiculous and funny. So we end it kind of on like a fun. Humorous note. You know just anything that just kind of makes a little bit more like ridiculous and extreme pretzels. Oh. alright! We'll see what we get there. And then last thing. and to be clear, these were all suggestions and edits for the level. 10 Sas. Post. I like that a lot better than the level 5 to 6 1. i thought the 5 to 6 1 was actually just like pretty flat and overall. Just not very inspiring up in that. Sas is definitely better. I was actually impressed or not impressed. I was surprised that it wasn't more sas, I guess, but worked out pretty well. I think we could like up up the Sas just a hair with a few more of those funny one-liners like I mentioned, but overall very good with that. and I would say, just like, Let's drop the second one and just kind of fell flat like I said, I don't think we need to really like. Do anything more with it. we'll just drop it for now and work on the 1st post. All right. Didn't mean to hit. Enter. Yeah, I want to put one more thing. Let's stop that minutes. It's so before I start speaking with the intro here. I do always like giving some kind of like starting with either encouragement, reinforcement, or kind of critiques right away, just to like. Let the AI know like where I stand on the content. You know I might say like this is not anything that I was looking for. I don't like any of this blah blah, or I might say like, Oh, my God, this is great, this fantastic start! Here's some edits I want to make stuff like that. I think that just does a good job like helping to prime the AI and knowing like is this, you know, like. is this going in a minor edits way, or like we go and rewrite right like there, there is something, and we'll get into that more. But there is like something about like activating different parts of their memory. This is a really good start. I like a lot of the edits and updates that we made. So far, I think we have just a little bit more to go. And I've put my suggestions, notes, ideas below here. I need you to analyze those and then rewrite and update the 1st version. Make it more in line with what I'm talking about, and just generally better. I really need to like find a better way to say like, Make it better, because, like. what does better mean? Right? So maybe actually, what we'll do. let's see, make it more aligned with my talk about, and at least 10% better. Then the current version and try that. And then we always want to go back down to the end and just do kind of a quick context, synopsis summary, and like one more time, like what we want to after analyzing your post above and all the additional contacts I've given you, I need you to rewrite the Facebook post. So it's more in line with what I said above. I want it to be a little bit funnier, too, and then also just ensure that it's 10% better and more interesting engaging for our coaching audience. Alright, let's see what happens there. And as it's chat as it's thinking and doing its thing. you know, I gotta wrap this up here because I've got another call. I have to run off to. But I think this is a great start with kind of showing like what you can do. both with just like the difference of how. And I think the main thing that like I want to show is like the difference between just like throwing in a prompt here and seeing what you get versus having one of these projects with a prompt already built into it. And mind you like, what we'll be doing in the next video is actually going over the brand kit and probably this specific prompt and refine it more right? Because it's like. well, let's see what. Let's see what happens. Let's see what we got with this rewritten version. Maximum. Wake up energy. Let me get hydrated first.st Stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do instead, because right now your cosplay is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that make content in their sleep. Yes, Karen, from your mastermind, the one who suddenly posts everywhere. She's not working hard. She just stopped playing intern. Last Tuesday I analyzed my coaching call recordings and discovered something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the robots handle it. Now. here's what I found. You're performing the same brilliant conversation 5 times a week, creating exactly 0 content from it. Then staring at canva at 11 pm. Trying to remember if you used Montserrat or railway last time. This is insane behavior. Think about Monday strategy session, where you drop pure gold. Tuesday group coaching masterclass everyone loved vanished. Wednesday. Sales. Call where you explain your entire methodology. Gone. Thursday workshop, where 3 people cried from breakthroughs, poof! Friday. Interview where you finally nailed your origin. Story, dust, 300 min of certified genius, 0 content created but sure spend money. Saturday bashing, content, translation, panic, Korean mediocre post where your coffee gets cold and your family wonders if you still live there. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice every single zoom call contains 12 to 15. Complete story arcs. The kind Andre chaperone charges 10 KA month to map out. I forgot to take this out like no one cares like if anybody even knows who's Andre Chaperon is like, I'd be surprised like he's very much more of a lifestyle business guy. But he's absolutely one of my favorite marking writers. So like. yeah, I forgot to mention that you know what we're just gonna go back and do that really quick. See, this is where I talk about like I will go back and redo this when I don't like something, or if I forgot something, and it really here, we'll put it here, because that's right around the same spot. Don't mention Andre chaperone, or really like any of the creators in my brand kit. Those aren't something to be explicitly referenced or said publicly. I gave those in the brand kit so that you have a better understanding of who I like to create content like or other creators that, like I enjoy their content, think they're good writers, things like that, and would be excited if someone thought my content was similar to theirs. So it's more so a design style thing, than anything that you should ever, ever, ever mention their name like I never want to see like their names come up unless it's something that like I've explicitly referenced that you're transforming, but never introduce their name on your own. Okay. alright. So we'll drop that back in there and give it a second to rewrite and again, like, that's, I think, a really important thing, too, is like, if you see some of those little errors as you go go back and redo this. It's gonna save you a lot as far as like context and conversations goes, because, like Claude has a limit. Chatgp doesn't really anymore. Now that it has the memory feature built in like. I haven't reached a conversation limit, but there are very real conversational limits with Claude now. So if you kind of go back and tweak this a bit. It also gives you a better starting spot right like from here. I would probably go back and keep redoing this and keep editing this until I get closer to what I wanted to the point of even like, maybe I would take this section out, or I'd re explain that section. So let's see what it said. Now stop creating content seriously. Stop, let your conversations do instead, because right now your cosplan is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that work while you sleep. Yes, you, the one who just opened canva in another tab. Close it. Here's what I discovered last Tuesday. So, you know, I'm still not super happy with this opening, and I don't think we're going to quite get there in this session, and that's what we're going to. I guess this is what I'll kind of leave you off with, and a little tease here is like the next thing that we're going to do in the next video is, I'm going to redo my brand kit. And I think we'll actually work on a structured prompts right? Like I have have this social post, right? We should probably have. Actually, you know, I'm gonna do this really quick. No, I'm not because I don't necessarily like this like this is just kind of like a placeholder to to get stuff going. So what will come back in this next video is restructuring this prompt and then kind of going back through the same similar exercise and showing like how to do it like. Quote unquote the right way, right like I. I would put this like the good wrong way, like, if you don't have your own Meta prompts create or structured prompts created where you can kind of consistently put. create content, a certain output. This would be the way that you really should be having a conversation with the ais like you start with something right. You have to give it some sort of draft piece finished piece, whatever it might be, the better that you can give it in the beginning. the better. The conversation is gonna go. But, like, you know, if you don't have a lot of marketing or copyright experience like that's fine, right, give it something and then work with it from there to improve it. And you know you can start with just saying like, Hey, first, st I need to create a rubric to make this better oops. and then from there it'll give you a bunch of ideas and things like that. If you need more suggestions, ask for more suggestions. You just go back and have this back and forth conversation until you get the way you want. And is there a pain? Kind of yeah. But what I'll show you in the next video is like how you can either a take that like a, you know, like we originally did in this one right? And it creates a prompt for it for this rubric, and you can go back in and then refine the prompt to be like exactly what you're looking for and then work with it from there, and kind of restart the conversation type of thing right? Because, like, if I went, I took this prompt actually, let's see what happens when I do take this prompt alright. Let's just see while I kind of blab on a little bit. So now this is actually taking that rubric that we gave, and it's going to edit it based on that right. And I'll probably come up with something like even better than what we had before, and you just kind of keep working out from there. And then, once you have that prompt d plus it got it went up a little bit interesting. But once you have that kind of base prompt, you can start to work with it and use it, and that's what we'll be doing in the next video is, I will actually be kind of going through of like creating a very structured prompt with, Hey, how to create a good lead, how to create a good hook, what goes in the body, and like more and more and more details about that. So I'm not having this kind of like back and forth where? You know, to be perfectly honest like that last those last couple of versions that it's not done. Those last couple versions that we saw. I'm like these are better. But again, like the hook lead is still just not quite there. So that's something that we can work on and fix with a really good, detailed, prompt. And that's what I'm going to be covering the next video here and now, just to end this out like, let's just take a look at what the difference is with putting in that much more explicit, prompt about with, like the actual rubric in there, generic opening 0 pattern interrupt right? Like. So it's saying a lot of similar things, you know, obviously, that we would think but is getting more insight into why, it's yes or no right complete voice mismatch. This reads like every Guru sales page, not pragmatic text, heavy blah, blah 0 brand characters where it's Atlas, where it's bit right? So like it's pretty similar to like what we've gone through already. But it gives more context, which would be super super helpful if you are someone who's newer to marketing, and you're just not entirely sure like why, this would be like good or bad. That opening is deader than Disco. The fake empathy is nauseating. You buried your actual differentiator. Your brand has 10 years experience, see? See? So like, that's that's a really interesting point that like hasn't been brought up yet. that it's saying that the actual differentiator is that experience. And like, where is any of that you know credibility. We get the trust me, Bro. Energy, right? So like this would be like, Hey, like, let's just make sure that we get that like higher up. You know, if you follow Alex from Osel with the proof promise plan, you know, starting out with a proof like 10 years experience 10 million dollars. 10 million words that kind of thing. let's see what it says for new. See? Like, look, look we didn't get this hook before, after writing 10 million words and building 500 plus automation flows. I've discovered the 7 min prompt chain that turns any zoom call into 30 pieces of content. So like it's not quite what I would use, just simply because, like, it's not totally accurate. But this much better hook than the last one. Right. I like it more than the stop creating content, and whatever else character driven story Atlas here last Tuesday had been analyzed. No right like we. Just my character's wrong. So we're just gonna have to drop the character stuff. Contrarian challenge. Your content. Strategy is backwards. Stop creating. Start capturing. Here's the na and M. Workflow that changed everything. Right? So if I want to go more of a technical route, maybe if I was going after like automation people and saying like, Hey, like I have a like a done for you, product that like you can sell and use and modify yourself like I might go that angle with that you know. But again the the, the prompt itself. kind of lacks a bit of understand like who my actual audience is, and simply because I just haven't updated updated with like, who I'm going after. Now, I've been kind of in a audience finding as I built this out. driving gold, sharing insights. I like that. I like that right? So like overall like I'm I'm enjoying these suggestions much better. And a cta that doesn't suck instead of drop a try. Curious how bit analyzes your calls. Watch them, dissect a real coaching session, extract 31 content pieces in 7 min. Link and comments. No email required like, I like this call to action a lot better again, if we just drop the character part of it. You know the linking comments. No email required. Basically, it's just saying, like, Hey, like, you want to see a demo of the system like you'll be able to watch. Send a comment. Just watch it. You don't have to do it. So right, this kind of inspires me of like, okay, like, maybe that's something I'll need to do as part of some of these posts is like, have that kind of follow on piece, and whether it's I don't know. Maybe it's just post, you know, like posting the full video like this to Youtube in the comments. So like, Hey, if you want to go deeper, check it out. So yeah, I'm gonna cut this here. I'm pretty sure we've gone on for longer than I thought. But I'm pretty pretty happy with how this how what we've gone through so far. And then I think the next thing that we'll do tomorrow is actually start to Start with the brand kit and the design Kit, I think it's really important to go into those. There's a few things I've learned since then that I'd like to Update and create like, I said, like I created these as like the minimum viable, prompt that I can have for all this stuff to like. Just get something that's generally correct like I said, like, I don't necessarily like a lot of this, but it was more for proof of concept, for the system to get something out there. And now what I'm going to be doing over the next few days is refining all this stuff and really putting some more thought and effort into it and getting getting this really down to the point where it's actually creating like content that I really really like. Because I know AI can do it. I've done it. I produced it. you know. A lot of it's just like in here, with some more back and forth, but with what I've really been learning the last couple months. I know that we can do this in the single shot with it here. So stay tuned for the next video where we're going to actually be diving into how to update and change some of these prompts so that they create better content and help AI create content that doesn't suck. Thanks for watching if you made it. This far, really enjoyed talking about this stuff and can't wait to talk more about it.\n\n{/Transcript}\n",
          "brand_story": "Brand Story: The Full Journey\nThe Origin Story\nThe Decade of Words\nFor 10 years, I lived in the trenches of digital marketing. Not as some guru selling courses, but as a craftsman—writing 10 million words that quietly drove over $10 million in revenue for clients. I wasn't the loudest voice in the room, but I was the one clients kept coming back to because the work actually worked.\nBut here's the thing about being good at something: sometimes it becomes a prison. I found myself spending 12-hour days staring at screens, crafting perfect copy for other people's dreams while my own life sat on pause.\nThe Breaking Point\nI bought a house a couple years ago—this beautiful fixer-upper with potential everywhere I looked. Garden beds waiting to be planted. Rooms begging for renovation. A workshop space perfect for building things with my hands. But for the last year and half? It just sat there, untouched, while I sat at my computer making other people money.\nThe irony wasn't lost on me: I was a tech enthusiast, someone who genuinely loved the intersection of marketing and technology, but I'd become enslaved by it. I'd always been the marketer who dabbled in code, the writer who understood systems, the creative who could think technically. But instead of that being freeing, it had become exhausting.\nThe Awakening\nThe Four-Year Evolution\nThis wasn't an overnight transformation. For four years, I've been in the AI trenches, watching it evolve from laughable to revolutionary. Each year brought new capabilities, new possibilities, and new understanding of what this technology could actually do.\nYear 1-2: Dabbling with early AI tools, building basic automations, convinced it was mostly hype\nYear 3 (The ChatGPT Moment): Complete paradigm shift, pivoted entire business model to AI-powered systems\nYear 4: Building the comprehensive system that connects all the pieces\nNow: Ready to share what actually works, not just what sounds impressive\nThe AI Moment\nI've been dabbling with AI for the last four years, back when most people thought it was still science fiction. For years, I was building out content systems, adding automation pieces as I learned them, convinced we were still a generation away from AI being actually useful. Honestly? I thought AI was terrible. The outputs were garbage, the process was clunky, and it felt more like a party trick than a tool.\nThen two years ago, ChatGPT launched.\nI was one of the first people to sign up, and within an hour, my entire worldview shifted. I remember sitting there thinking, \"Oh my god, copywriting is going to be taken over by AI in like a year. I need to do something completely different.\"\nThat moment of panic became my biggest opportunity. Instead of running from AI, I dove straight into the deep end—not into the AI itself, but into the automation and systems side. I completely pivoted my freelancing model, started building AI-powered systems and automations for content agencies.\nWhat I discovered after two years in those trenches changed everything. Clients kept asking me to handle more and more of their marketing because, frankly, I did the best work of anyone they hired. But I physically couldn't scale myself. That's when it hit me: what if I could externalize all my knowledge—10 years of copywriting, marketing, campaign creation—into workflows that leverage AI to create content like I would, while giving clients ownership and flexibility?\nThe First Experiments\nThe common thread through all my learning was frustrating: I kept seeing people build these neat AI examples as proof of concepts—cool demos showing what AI could theoretically do. But as actual business use cases? Something you could leverage in a real content generation business to do something productive? That just didn't exist.\nMost of these systems were one-off tools, party tricks that were part of something but never worked together as a cohesive unit. Nothing actually took care of the full content creation process. You'd have a tool for writing, another for editing, another for scheduling, but they didn't talk to each other. It was like having a kitchen full of appliances but no recipes.\nI wanted to build something different: an end-to-end system that made it dead simple for someone to create content and get it published everywhere they wanted it to be. Because here's the truth—I've struggled with this myself. I'd create content that never saw the light of day for any number of reasons. Writer's block, perfectionism, technical hurdles, time constraints.\nBut this is bigger than just solving my own problem. I fully believe a huge part of our future—both work and meaning—will be people sharing what they're interested in with the world through social media. Legacy media is dying. More and more people are turning to solo creators and independent media for their information, entertainment, and education.\nI want to empower people to supplement their income and create the life they want by creating content on topics they actually care about. Not by joining the AI slop factory, but by sharing their own genuine thoughts and experiences. Used right, AI can be a powerful tool for cleaning up the internet and creating much better content that makes the world a better place—not contributing to the \"dead internet\" theory where everything feels fake and soulless.\nThe Pivot\nBuilding the System\nI became obsessed. Not with making more money or scaling bigger, but with a simple question: \"How can one person create like they have a team, without actually having a team?\"\nThe system I started building wasn't about viral hacks or template libraries. It was about externalizing a decade of marketing knowledge into something tangible and reusable. Taking real conversations—the actual words people say when they're passionate about their work—and transforming them into the content they need.\nThink of it as bottling expertise. Every campaign I'd run, every piece of copy that converted, every content strategy that worked—all of it coded into workflows that could think like I think, write like I write, but without me having to be there. No generic AI slop. No soulless corporate speak. Just authentic voice, clarified and multiplied.\nThis is the system I wish I'd had when clients kept asking for more. The system that could scale my thinking without scaling my hours. The system that proves you don't need a team when you have the right technology applied the right way.\nThe Realization\nBut as I built this system, something unexpected happened. I realized I didn't want to use it to work MORE. I wanted to use it to work LESS. Not because I'm lazy, but because I finally understood something crucial:\nThe point of technology isn't to do more work. It's to do less work so we can do more living.\nThe Secret Project\nA Different Path\nWhile building this AI system, I made a decision that would seem crazy to most people in the online business world: I'm going back to school for nursing. At 35 years old, I'm completely changing careers.\nWhy? Because I discovered that what I actually hate isn't work—it's sitting at a computer all day. I want to be up, moving, talking to people face-to-face, doing something that matters in the physical world. But I also love technology, love building systems, love the creative challenge of making AI do incredible things.\nSo instead of choosing one or the other, I'm designing a life that includes both.\nThe Living Proof\nThis isn't theoretical. I'm literally using the system I'm building to create the income that will let me go to nursing school. I'm proving that you can use AI to buy back your time, to create the flexibility to pursue what actually matters to you.\nThe secret project I keep hinting at? It's not just nursing school. It's demonstrating that the future of work isn't about choosing between technology and humanity—it's about using technology to become MORE human.\nThe Mission\nThe Creator Economy Revolution\nLegacy media is dying, and that's not a tragedy—it's an opportunity. Every day, more people turn to independent creators for news, education, entertainment, and connection. The gatekeepers are gone. The middlemen are obsolete. But most creators are still stuck playing by the old rules, trying to compete on volume instead of value.\nI'm building for the new rules. Where one person with the right system can compete with entire media companies. Where authenticity beats production value. Where serving a thousand true fans beats chasing millions of strangers.\nThis isn't about everyone becoming a \"content creator\" in the influencer sense. It's about professionals, experts, and interesting people sharing their knowledge and perspectives without having to become media companies. The nurse who revolutionizes patient education. The plumber who teaches homeowners DIY fixes. The accountant who makes tax strategy actually interesting.\nBeyond Templates\nI'm tired of the template toddler mentality that's taken over the online space. Everyone's selling the same fill-in-the-blank frameworks, the same \"viral formulas,\" the same generic garbage that makes every brand sound identical.\nMy approach is different. Yes, it takes more upfront work. You have to build your brand kit, train your prompts, understand your voice. But then? Then you have a system that's YOURS. That sounds like YOU. That creates content you're actually proud of.\nThe Craftsman's Way\nI'm not building for scale. I'm not trying to be the next billion-dollar SaaS. I'm a craftsman who likes being in the trenches, building cool stuff that actually works. I'd rather make something remarkable for a thousand true fans than something mediocre for a million strangers.\nThis is the Kevin Kelly principle in action: if you can get a thousand people to pay you a thousand dollars a year, you have a million-dollar business. That's my north star. A thousand people in my community paying $99 a month. Not because they have to, but because the value is so obvious they'd be crazy not to.\nA thousand people is the sweet spot. Big enough to create real impact and sustainable income. Small enough that it still feels like a community, not a faceless mass. Small enough that I can still get my hands dirty with the actual building.\nThis is why I'm only taking 10 beta clients to start. Why I'm building a community, not an empire. Why I'm keeping things intimate enough that real relationships can form.\nThe Real Promise\nHere's what I'm NOT promising:\nPassive income (that's a lie—good things require active participation)\nViral content (virality is luck, not strategy)\nWorking from a beach (sand in your laptop sucks)\nHere's what I AM promising:\nReplace the replaceable parts of your work\nKeep your authentic voice while multiplying your output\nSpend less time at your computer, more time living your life\nBuild something you actually own, not rent from a faceless corp\nThe Community Vision\nPeople Like Us\nI'm building for a specific type of person. Not the empire builders or the grind culture warriors. But the lifestyle designers. The people who see business as a means to freedom, not an end in itself.\nPeople who:\nValue time over scale\nWant to help others without sacrificing themselves\nBelieve technology should serve life, not consume it\nAre tired of choosing between authenticity and efficiency\nThe Dinner Party Test\nI think gatherings over food are going to be huge in the future. As we spend more time online, the value of in-person connection skyrockets. That's my test for success: Am I building something that gives people more time for dinner parties? More time for gardens? More time for the projects that actually matter to them?\nThe Path Forward\nDaily Proof\nEvery day, I'm documenting this journey. Not as a guru with all the answers, but as someone figuring it out alongside you. My daily videos aren't about what you SHOULD do—they're about what I DID do, what worked, what didn't, and what I learned.\nThe Three-Month Sprint\nRight now, it's August 2025. By November, I need this system humming because nursing school starts in January. This isn't some arbitrary deadline—it's real life demanding real results.\nThe immediate goal: 10 beta clients at $2,500 each. That funds the next phase while proving the system works. But the real vision? A thousand true fans paying $99/month. That's $99,000 in monthly recurring revenue. That's freedom to pursue nursing while still building cool stuff. That's proof that you can have multiple careers without sacrificing any of them.\nThis urgency is a gift. It means I can't waste time on things that don't matter. Every feature I build has to earn its place. Every piece of content has to serve a purpose. Every decision gets filtered through a simple question: \"Does this help someone create better content with less effort?\"\nThe Bigger Picture\nThis isn't just about my journey. It's about proving a new model for how we can live and work in the AI age. We don't have to choose between technology and humanity. We don't have to sacrifice our lives for our businesses. We don't have to become what we build.\nWe can use AI to reclaim our time, to amplify our true voices, to create the exact lives we want. Not someday. Not after we \"make it.\" But right now, starting today, one prompt at a time.\n\nCore Story Elements\nThe Conflict\nExternal: The online world pushing everyone toward generic, scaled, soulless content Internal: The tension between loving technology and hating computer-bound life\nThe Discovery\nAfter four years in the AI trenches—from skeptic to builder—I discovered that AI isn't about replacing human creativity. It's about externalizing human expertise into systems that amplify voice while eliminating drudgery. It's about bottling ten years of marketing knowledge into workflows anyone can use.\nThe Transformation\nFrom burnt-out service provider to lifestyle architect, using AI to build a life that includes both meaningful tech work AND meaningful human work\nThe Proof\nFour years of building and testing AI systems that actually work in production\nTwo years running AI-powered content systems for agencies\nDaily content across all platforms without sacrificing quality or authenticity\nBeta clients getting real results with minimal input\nActively transitioning to nursing while building this business\nLiving evidence that you can use AI to work less and live more\nClear path to a thousand true fans and sustainable creator income\nThe Invitation\nJoin me in the trenches. Not as followers, but as fellow builders. Let's figure out how to use AI to create the lives we actually want, not just the businesses we think we need.\n\nThis is a living document. As the journey continues, new chapters will be added, lessons will be learned, and the story will evolve. That's the point—we're not selling a finished system, we're building something together.\n\n\n"

I've generated over 10 million dollars in revenue for online coaches over the last 10 years, written over 10 million words of content for clients in that time frame to\r\n\r\n2\r\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:38.800\r\nFrancis: done a bunch of other stuff. But a lot of what I've been doing lately. The last 4 years is really diving deep into AI last 2 years. Everything that I've been paid for to write for clients has been produced by AI, and I've never gotten more compliments. So\r\n\r\n3\r\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.030\r\nFrancis: I would say, yes, yes, AI can write content. That doesn't suck.\r\n\r\n4\r\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.289\r\nFrancis: but it can't read your mind. And I think that's really the core of what a lot of people\r\n\r\n5\r\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:16.370\r\nFrancis: misunderstand about AI. They think because it's so intelligent and knows all these things right, like AI is at Phd level intelligence right now, like researchers, medical doctors like they're using this to discover like new things about science. It's not coming up with new stuff yet, but I mean, it's super super smart. So it can write content. It absolutely can. But\r\n\r\n6\r\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.979\r\nFrancis: just because it's really smart doesn't mean it can read your mind. We're gonna\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:35.089\r\nFrancis: scroll up here. Here's a little bit of structure. We're gonna try to see what we get through today with these. But this, I think, will turn into a multi-part series here. And what I'm going to actually be doing\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:57.809\r\nFrancis: is going through, really, how I create prompts, how I think about prompting context engineering things like that. I really like to prefer just client conversation structure. Right. I know that the tech people are going to be all mad at me and stuff like that, and prompted sharing. But\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:09.560\r\nFrancis: we're just talking AI here right. AI is built very, very much like humans. And how we think it's just, it's trained on the Internet, right? So there is a lot of how we think.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:20.100\r\nFrancis: and how humans think already baked into AI, and those things that you think are like weird about AI like hallucinations. One of my favorite things, everybody's like, Oh, AI hallucinates.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:31.199\r\nFrancis: So do people right? Like a hallucination is just something that's made up. And what is creativity at its core is making stuff up right. And then also, too, like\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.989\r\nFrancis: humans will make stuff up all the time if they like.\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:46.630\r\nFrancis: Don't know the answer, and don't want to seem stupid, so they'll constantly say whatever they can think of. That might sound smart, right whatever. So\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:56.989\r\nFrancis: AI works a lot like humans. And and when you think of it like that. It makes it a lot easier to work with instead of treating it like this\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.170\r\nFrancis: all-knowing thing that you can just be like, Hey, create a\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.459\r\nFrancis: you know Facebook post for me. Right? We'll get into this a little bit more in a minute.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.307\r\nFrancis: Here we go.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.369\r\nFrancis: right. So this is Claude. This is a new 4.1 opus model that just dropped.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:47.769\r\nFrancis: You can use any model. It really doesn't matter. At this point I'll get more of that. But it's largely preference. But I go write me a viral Facebook post for online coaches that would get them to want to use my content automation system that automatically takes Zoom calls, turn them into clips and turns those clips in different pieces of written and image asset content. Put me together a long form Facebook post that will attract new clients and have them reaching out to me.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:07.339\r\nFrancis: Word to the wise. Make sure you hit record. Before starting this I record about an hour and a half of me going through all of this and totally forgot to hit record. So we're coming back through and basically going to walk through what I did with a lot of this stuff and kind of pick up\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:17.190\r\nFrancis: where we left off here. So hopefully, we'll shorten things down. Probably not shorten things. But you're gonna get a lot more out of it than I did the 1st time around.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.330\r\nFrancis: So that's a prompt right? That's a the beginning of a conversation with AI. And\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.270\r\nFrancis: this is a great example of expecting AI\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:45.259\r\nFrancis: to read my mind right? I want long form Facebook posts that will attract new clients and have them reach out to me. I mean, that sounds fairly specific, right? Like.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.159\r\nFrancis: you might be able to say this to\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.659\r\nFrancis: a very experienced marketer copywriter, and they could go and\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.159\r\nFrancis: turn out some good content for you\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:07.398\r\nFrancis: from here, but more than likely not because they don't, you know, if they don't know a lot about you, that's that's really it like, why AI writes bad content.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:22.870\r\nFrancis: it's because a lack of understanding about you, right? You know you're not probably Hubspot or Alex her Mosey, or you know some giant creator out there where there's tons and tons and tons of\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.609\r\nFrancis: knowledge about you that the AI can just go and grab. You have to give it all that, because here.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.260\r\nFrancis: when you don't this is the kind of stuff you get.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:56.449\r\nFrancis: I just watched a coach spend 4 h turning one zoom call into social media content, and I wanted to scream. Here's what they did, rewatched the entire 6 min recording manually wrote down Timestamps for the good parts edited. 3 clips took forever, wrote captions from scratch created, quote cards in canva, posted everything manually\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:19.700\r\nFrancis: manually. Total time, 4 plus hours for maybe 5 pieces of content. Meanwhile I'm over here turning my zoom calls into 30 plus pieces of content in under 10 min, not because I'm some content genius, but because I finally built a system I wish existed when I was grinding 16 h days. Here's the truth most Gurus won't tell you. Your best content is already happening every single day.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:30.279\r\nFrancis: It's in your coaching calls. It's in your group sessions. It's in your masterminds. You're literally dropping gold in your Zoom Rooms, then letting it disappear into the cloud, while you're stressing about what? To post tomorrow?\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:48.970\r\nFrancis: Quick question. What if every time you hit end meeting on zoom, you automatically got 10 to 15 video clips, edit caption rate of post quote cards with the best one, liars, full transcripts turned into blog posts, email sequences from your teaching points, Linkedin articles from your frameworks, Instagram carousels from your key concept.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.370\r\nFrancis: tweet threads from your golden nuggets\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:07:07.259\r\nFrancis: without lifting a finger without hiring a Va without learning complicated software. This is in theory. Last week, 1 45 min strategy session I did became 12 Instagram reels, 8 Linkedin posts, 3 blog articles, 15. Quote cards, one email sequence\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.630\r\nFrancis: content, scheduled for 3 weeks from one call, the same call. I was doing anyways.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:27.779\r\nFrancis: Look, I get it. You became a coach to coach, not to become a content factory. But here's what we both know. No content equals, no visibility, no visibility equals no clients, no clients, equals no impact. And you didn't build this business to be the world's best kept secret.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:36.630\r\nFrancis: The coaches crushing it right now. They're not smarter than you. They're not better coaches than you. They just show up everywhere because they have systems that multiply their message while they sleep.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:46.130\r\nFrancis: Here's what I believe your expertise deserves to be heard. Your message needs to reach people waiting for it. Your impact shouldn't be limited by how many hours you can spend on camera\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.220\r\nFrancis: Canada.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:07:47.590 --> 00:08:07.790\r\nFrancis: So I built something that handles all of it. Upload your Zoom recording. Walk away, come back to a month's worth of content, fair warning. This might feel like cheating when you post 5 times more without working harder when your engagement explodes, because you're finally consistent when leads start sliding to your dms, asking how you're everywhere. You might feel a little guilty. You'll get over it when you see your bank account.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:35.979\r\nFrancis: I'm only bringing on 10 coaches this month, not because of fake scarcity, but because I personally onboard everyone to make sure they're getting results within 48 h. If you're done with staring at blank screens, posting sporadically and hoping for the best watching competitors dominate your feed, knowing you have value, but struggling to package it, and you're ready for content creation on autopilot, showing up consistently without burning out, without burnout train, every conversation to marking gold.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.730\r\nFrancis: actually having time to coach instead of create. Then we should talk.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:53.879\r\nFrancis: Drop a rocket below or DM, Me. Automate. Right now I'll send you 3 min video showing the entire system in action. No sales calls required, no pushy tactics. Just watch the video and decide if you want your content to be\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:22.050\r\nFrancis: that this easy, because your next zoom call could be 30 pieces of content, or it could be another lost opportunity. Your choice, Ps. Every day you wait is literally content. Gold sitting in your zoom cloud that could be bringing you clients just saying, Pps, that coach who spent 4 h on content. They're now my client. Last week they posted 47 pieces of content and booked. 6 discovery calls from 2 zoom recordings. This could be you.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:35.009\r\nFrancis: This post uses psychology triggers like Fomo, social proof transformation stories and clear benefits while maintaining authenticity and addressing the real pain, points online coaches face without content or with content. Creation?\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.590\r\nFrancis: No?\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.167\r\nFrancis: Well, I was pretty confident that was\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:55.310\r\nFrancis: Those are good posts there, right? And that's how AI works. Right? It wants to be a helpful assistant. There's a\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:19.370\r\nFrancis: if you read the Claude system promise in like 5,000 words or lines, but in there it talks a lot about like how its ultimate goal is to be helpful. If you ever heard of the the clawed, vending machine experiment where it did. Terrible. That's this, because the system prompt is designed to be helpful. So like it thinks it's being helpful here, and it's always going to try to\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:26.289\r\nFrancis: fulfill your request as best it can with what's what it's given right? Because, like.\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.710\r\nFrancis: that's the weird thing about AI as smart as these models are.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.300\r\nFrancis: At the end of the day. They're still\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:43.780\r\nFrancis: prediction algorithms and prediction machines, which essentially is what humans are too like that. Our brains are prediction machines like everything that we see\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.460\r\nFrancis: and\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:11:01.189\r\nFrancis: the words on the screen. All this is just light that comes into our eyes and our brain interprets and predicts like what it should be. Right like. We have that blind spot in our eyes so like something in here is, I'm not actually seeing.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:12.570\r\nFrancis: So we predict stuff, too, you know, no same way, like when you interrupt someone and finish their sentence thinking, like, you know, what they're about to say, like, you're doing the same thing.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.180\r\nFrancis: So let's stop harping on AI\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.540\r\nFrancis: about how it does this poorly and figure out how to fix it right, because, like\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:30.099\r\nFrancis: this isn't the worst post ever right, you know, you might think it's written by AI. I don't know.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:36.050\r\nFrancis: I feel like people kind of like jump the gun and go overboard on that these days. Everything's AI written.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:47.320\r\nFrancis: but it's not great right? This kind of feels like something a template toddler would have written. You know, those are those copywriters who've just masked\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:56.230\r\nFrancis: template after template over the years and just fill in the blank. It's like, oh, here, put 5 bullets about this and do 5 bullets about that.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.609\r\nFrancis: So all this stuff comes out a little bit too formulaic, and\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:11.529\r\nFrancis: I get it. There's a time and a place for that, especially early on. But the cool thing about AI, and like what's really awesome about AI is you can move beyond templates\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:23.209\r\nFrancis: for your content, and, like kind of go up a chain with prompt templates, which we'll get into that. But I mean, those are essentially Meta and structured prompts\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:33.499\r\nFrancis: that we'll go into, and these allow you to change and input different variables and get way better, more\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.720\r\nFrancis: personalized, bespoke content. But still, in\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.459\r\nFrancis: whatever framework and structure you like to create content. Right? Like\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:12:45.150 --> 00:13:10.419\r\nFrancis: all of them, work to a degree whether you do problem, agitate solution. Very heavy story focused more in your face. So like it doesn't. It doesn't matter what kind of content you want to create like pick something that resonates with you because of the authenticity part is going to matter the most, and you can use AI to help you get to that like we'll be getting into brand kits and design kits later. And this is just like a lot of back information\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.089\r\nFrancis: that we will be kind of feeding to the AI. So it knows what to talk about\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:28.159\r\nFrancis: or at least how to talk about the things we want to talk about. I think that's a better way to put it so like, let me take a step back, really quick. And\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:40.789\r\nFrancis: I'm creating this video right now as part of my build in public series where I'm building out my content repurposing system, which, like here's part of it. But essentially it takes a zoom call\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.600\r\nFrancis: or any kind of long form. Video\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:59.369\r\nFrancis: turns it into a bunch of different clips, right? So it formats them, finds the best moments. Things like that cuts it from the video. If you ever used opus clips, it's kind of the same thing as that. But just like done programmatically.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:06.570\r\nFrancis: Then turns each one of those clips in different quotes, Facebook posts, Linkedin posts, emails like whatever you want.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.980\r\nFrancis: and then puts all of that oops wrong. One.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:14:16.892 --> 00:14:23.515\r\nFrancis: Here's some tests I was doing. I just finished putting the auto scheduling part in here.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:36.950\r\nFrancis: Oh, finish putting the on scheduling part in here. So like we'll be building more of this out. And now what I'm doing is coming back and updating\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:43.319\r\nFrancis: all of my prompts. So I've got this prompt stock here. And what's really cool about the system I built is that\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:49.689\r\nFrancis: any anything that has a copywriter as the job role. It's going to\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:56.639\r\nFrancis: use a clip transcript and create content around that. Right? So I've got what was this one social post\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.709\r\nFrancis: quotes is that it? Okay, email\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.260\r\nFrancis: brain dump, not using that, the Oprah plant beta, not using that.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:34.179\r\nFrancis: Yeah. So what I'm gonna be doing is updating these prompts, maybe change them up, doing a few different ones, and likely this will be in part 2 or 3 that we get into some of like the actual, like redoing of these prompts. But I just got all the automation parts up, especially like this auto publishing bit. And now I'm ready to come back\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.539\r\nFrancis: and work through oops. That's a creature, the copywriter.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.440\r\nFrancis: This goes to a different post. That does all that. But\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:52.369\r\nFrancis: coming to update those prompts so that I now actually have really cool stuff that I can post.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.080\r\nFrancis: And\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:21.589\r\nFrancis: that's what brings us here. And that's why I'm talking about all this prompt AI conversation stuff. Because I think one of the most important skills that we can start to develop as humans is learning how to talk to AI, because the fact of the matter is, it's only going to become a bigger and bigger part of the world we live in. It is going to be one of the greatest unlocks\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:28.490\r\nFrancis: of prosperity that we have seen. I am a big believer in that. I\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.609\r\nFrancis: I don't think there's another way that it can go with\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:40.139\r\nFrancis: how things are right now. And that's a video for another time. But I I am very.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:56.930\r\nFrancis: very hopeful, very pro AI. I think it's gonna do a lot of cool things, and we can get into all that in another video if people want to hear my thoughts on that. But for now what I can talk really well about is how you talk to these models, because I've had hundreds and hundreds of conversations with them\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.639\r\nFrancis: over the last 2 years. I spend 4 h plus\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.100\r\nFrancis: a day, you know. I'd say at least\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:15.589\r\nFrancis: 5 to 6 days a week. I spend 4 h plus talking with AI over the last 2 years. So I have have figured out a thing or 2,\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:40.699\r\nFrancis: and that's really the biggest, the biggest thing that I see when people are struggling with using AI is that they just don't know how to talk to it right? Like they'll put in, maybe a prompt like this to get started. And that's it. Right? They'll they'll look at this and be like, Oh, this is whatever I don't like it. It's okay. Take what it is, and it's like.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:49.968\r\nFrancis: There's so much more. There's so much more that you can do with all this right like this is not even scratching the surface.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.750\r\nFrancis: But what I will say. What I will say\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:03.490\r\nFrancis: is, if you are a brand new coach like you just got into this you know. I don't know. You teach underwater basket weaving. Right?\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.330\r\nFrancis: Let's\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:16.779\r\nFrancis: let's say you teach underwater basketball. You have. AI create a post like this. You never done any marketing before. You've just been a social media lurker. You know you want to like. Everybody loves your underwater\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:22.599\r\nFrancis: baskets and think they're so cool. So you start doing as a thing right. Whatever teach other people how to do it.\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:36.850\r\nFrancis: I would post this right if I if I don't know anything about content creation, copywriting, what I'm supposed to do like. I'll read through like reading through this. I'm like, Wow, like it says all the things that like\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:48.619\r\nFrancis: I need it to say. And this actually kind of scared me because it's like I felt like I knew a little bit more than it should, but apparently with the new cloud updates over the last couple days it's instituted.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:55.940\r\nFrancis: A similar kind of memory feature is Chatgpt. That's 1 of the coolest things about Chat Gpt right now is that\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:11.319\r\nFrancis: it has memory so it can look back at your previous conversations and kind of get to know you and store things about you that you talk about frequently and are important. You know my chat. Gpt knows me very, very well.\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:28.369\r\nFrancis: If you use chat, gpt a lot, ask it to roast you, and don't let it get off with the 1st one. It'll probably be pretty weak, but be like no, no, really roast me. I want you to take the gloves off and just like, go for it. It's funny. It's funny. It's got some good stuff. So\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:36.859\r\nFrancis: a lot of cool things you can do with AI once it has that memory component in there, right? So talking about like a few\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.279\r\nFrancis: few of these different things just like, oh, I remember talking about that before, so\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:20:12.740\r\nFrancis: you can do some cool stuff right off the bat, just saying those things right. You see, it's got a good structure. It adds emojis in there. So it's clear to read. But if you're someone who's been in the online coaching space for a minute, or just kind of done any kind of marketing. You'll very quickly see the holes in this, and how it's pretty generic, and sounds exactly like something a Guru\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:19.850\r\nFrancis: marketing guru or coaching, Guru would like say or put together as like a template post for you to go fill out like\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:27.859\r\nFrancis: being in the industry for a minute. It's just like, Oh, my God! This reeks of like all the things that scream\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:33.713\r\nFrancis: marketing coach, there are a few things I like in there.\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.760\r\nFrancis: yeah, this is. This is a really good part.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:20:39.432 --> 00:20:40.940\r\nFrancis: What they're eating.\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.889\r\nFrancis: Best test secret. I kind of like that, you know, this lead and Intro is very weak.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:53.329\r\nFrancis: There's nothing intriguing or exciting about it. And you know, and that's something we're like.\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:20:53.820 --> 00:21:00.710\r\nFrancis: AI really fails that kind of out of the box. You have to get a lot of instructions.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:18.490\r\nFrancis: And tell, you know, like more context, right? That's that's the thing that we'll kind of really be getting into with all this and going back and forth talking a lot about AI writes bad content. Because can I go over a little bit?\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.390\r\nFrancis: Oh, wait! Hold on!\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.390\r\nFrancis: If any of you guys have a remarkable, that's what I'm using right now. And\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:36.700\r\nFrancis: it's the 1st time I've used it on the computer with color.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:51.429\r\nFrancis: Oh, that's cool. Right? So lack of context is why AI writes bad content period full stop.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:58.960\r\nFrancis: That is really what's going on here is you haven't given enough context. It cannot read your mind.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.970\r\nFrancis: so it doesn't know what to put right like.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:10.878\r\nFrancis: I didn't watch a coach do this last week, you know, and I have no idea what I did last week. But\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:20.740\r\nFrancis: yeah, but because I finally built a fit system, I wish existed when I was growing up like, Yeah, I wish that is true. I wish I had this. This is why I built it out.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:25.990\r\nFrancis: You know. Here's what most Gurus won't tell you. It's such a typical Guru line.\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:22:26.765 --> 00:22:41.619\r\nFrancis: Your content salary happening every single day. It's in your coach. Go like, I like this a lot, right? This is this is a really good good section there, really dropping gold in your zoom, you know, dropping gold. That's kind of cliche.\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.710\r\nFrancis: Yeah, this could be useful right? Like, that's\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:23:01.169\r\nFrancis: while you're stressing, you know, like stressing out what to post tomorrow. It's very common pain point for coaches, content creators, things like that so not bad. We could we could do something better with it?\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.500\r\nFrancis: Quick question with every time you hit and mean on zoom, right? So like this is\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.019\r\nFrancis: a pretty good section here, right? It could be used better, or\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.059\r\nFrancis: we can lead into it a little bit better.\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:23:16.657 --> 00:23:23.450\r\nFrancis: Without lifting a finger without hiring a Bia without learning complicated software again like this is very, very, very\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.250\r\nFrancis: copy paste, template Guru type. Speak here.\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.090\r\nFrancis: Theory, right?\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:45.039\r\nFrancis: That is a very Guru transition. It's cool that like AI is picking up on this stuff. Right? I think, like, take a second to appreciate that just asking it to write\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:51.038\r\nFrancis: a viral Facebook post for online coaches like the little context I gave it.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:23:52.780 --> 00:24:02.890\r\nFrancis: yeah, this is very much structured, like a coaching industry post that I've seen over and over again. Very, very similar frame frameworks.\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.120\r\nFrancis: Look, I get it again. Guru transition.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.909\r\nFrancis: Like I said, before, I like.\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.590\r\nFrancis: I like this this part a lot.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.259\r\nFrancis: this isn't bad, right?\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.250\r\nFrancis: So overall overall.\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:35.789\r\nFrancis: If you've never done this before like post, it like this would be something way better than like a Newbie coach who just like\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:43.610\r\nFrancis: found the industry quit their 9 to 5, you know, whatever. So it's not bad. But we can do a lot a lot better.\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:51.810\r\nFrancis: and you know what. Let's try that once, because I have another thing I'm going to show you.\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:25:06.380\r\nFrancis: But this could be a fun exercise. Really, quick, if anybody noticed this little thing here, this is whisper flow highly. Highly. Recommend it. It is an awesome software.\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:10.500\r\nFrancis: and just make me a little smaller over here.\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.150\r\nFrancis: Boom!\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.239\r\nFrancis: Awesome. Whisper flows off software. So you basically can hold\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:30.649\r\nFrancis: hold on your fn key and it will start and then dictate in the mouse, but it uses a little bit of AI to clean up the speech, and actually like\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:57.610\r\nFrancis: writes it out well, because you know how we talk. We'll drop a like and and this thing and that thing we might. There's been times where I've kind of like stumbled over my words like, oh, no, that's not it. And it will actually take that part out and kind of clean up. So it's super cool, highly recommend. You've got a hand. You know a lock feature to where you hit the space bar and just like talk for a while. So if you ever use the built in Mac.\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:08.219\r\nFrancis: Dictation thing. It kind of sucks because, like after a while, just like wig out and stop writing. And also like, I think, it's\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:19.906\r\nFrancis: speech to text capabilities. Aren't that great like AI is real? Or, excuse me, Apple's really shit the bed on AI, which is a topic for another day. But\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.487\r\nFrancis: whisper flow is 100% worth in awesome\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:34.310\r\nFrancis: really, big fan. They also have like a a notes feature, too. So you can just like record yourself for a while. So if you use\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.319\r\nFrancis: like otter or something like that, this could probably replace it.\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.099\r\nFrancis: So what I'm gonna do here is.\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.730\r\nFrancis: start the conversation right? Because it's like too many people would take this.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:57.370\r\nFrancis: and if you're a good marketing, be like, oh, this is garbage. I wouldn't use this blah blah and say, AI sucks, or\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.800\r\nFrancis: if\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:04.599\r\nFrancis: you're a Newbie marketer, or like Newbie coach, you'll be like, Oh, this is pretty good. I'll use this.\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:11.440\r\nFrancis: But if we continue the conversation, if we treat AI more like\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:20.859\r\nFrancis: an agency partner or a contractor that we work with you, you wouldn't just like.\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:32.400\r\nFrancis: say this sucks like I'm not going to use it. I'll talk to you next time, right like, if you pay a contractor for content, and you don't like it. What are you? Gonna do you tell them what you don't like? Ask them to redo it.\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:39.619\r\nFrancis: That's what AI is going to do right? The main difference here with AI is\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.120\r\nFrancis: one. It's gonna do exactly what you tell it and nothing else.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.400\r\nFrancis: 2 is going to do a lot faster and 3.\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.339\r\nFrancis: It's not going to complain or get butt hurt\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:27:52.450 --> 00:28:00.550\r\nFrancis: that you want some changes made right. And and I say that as a copywriter who has worked with clients for 10 years\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.549\r\nFrancis: and been paid a lot of money\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:09.899\r\nFrancis: to write content. And you know, I've been paid $5,000 to write 5 emails before\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:28.280\r\nFrancis: I get a little butter. Sometimes, if I give something to a client like I don't really like this part I'm like, but I really do right. And at the end of the day it's 1 of those things where, like humans, will always have an ego or bias into it. AI will only have the ego or bias that you give it.\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:34.399\r\nFrancis: So you can kind of train some of these things out of it. And I will show you.\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.580\r\nFrancis: Yeah, we'll just show you that right now. So the 1st thing I did\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:45.860\r\nFrancis: is alright. Let's go to the left side. So we got this up, and you see right above that we got. Oh, dang it! Go back! Go back! Go back!\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:57.939\r\nFrancis: I was close one hopefully. You see that. So this is another cloud version, this is my desktop, and you see I have this everyday OS content. Creator, let's go back here. Boom! So\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:07.979\r\nFrancis: this is a Claude project. So anytime I talk to Claude in here, it's going to automatically apply this system prompt.\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:16.599\r\nFrancis: And it's going to have this in its memory. Right? This is my prompt stock. These are all the prompts I'm working with. That showed you\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.859\r\nFrancis: right here. We've got my brand kit.\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:27.959\r\nFrancis: which is this. So this gives a bunch of information about the AI that will be changing up a ton\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.619\r\nFrancis: and then design Kit. That's not the pretty version.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.049\r\nFrancis: There you go. Here's a pretty version. So\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:40.670\r\nFrancis: got the design kit. And this is basically the brand kit. But for visual stuff, right?\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:49.810\r\nFrancis: And this are basically just very detailed instructions, right? So\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.697\r\nFrancis: tells it gives a little bit context, high level, what we're doing.\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:01.770\r\nFrancis: user request. I gotta update this. I don't think this quite works\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.359\r\nFrancis: in Claude. I'm not 100% sure, because I'm pretty positive it's not pulling.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:19.110\r\nFrancis: I don't know. That's part of what we're going to be going over in the next video here. And then just like, if I was working with, you know, junior copywriter, Va, we\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:40.839\r\nFrancis: video editor, whoever you want to give them a series of step-by-step instructions. Right? Analyze the requests, search for matching prompts, select a prompt create a custom, prompt if needed, right. And that's a really cool thing. And why I like using Claude, for this is because\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:48.410\r\nFrancis: it has very good agentic features. Which means, I can, you know, without\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:56.860\r\nFrancis: creating some complicated workflow or automation. Just give it all of my prompts in that prompt doc. Right? So we have.\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:11.519\r\nFrancis: You know, all these prompts in here that we're going to expand out, you know some of these short ones are just for clipping animation and don't really need a prompt. They're just yeah the games that another time but\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.450\r\nFrancis: it can go through\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:23.089\r\nFrancis: select a prompt, if no suitable, prompt matches, it will create a custom prompt to go through it right?\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:28.480\r\nFrancis: And figure out the thing based on these structures.\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:45.969\r\nFrancis: transformation, right? So like, oh, this is actually a good thing to to go over. I am a big believer that we, as marketers, coaches, content creators should not\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:56.849\r\nFrancis: be relying on AI to create original content for us. It can help us with the ideation, phase, and all of that. But to\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:05.810\r\nFrancis: have AI write something for you from scratch, I think, is not a very good idea, right? As we were kind of\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.980\r\nFrancis: we showed in this. It's not great. And I'll show you why.\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:16.300\r\nFrancis: In a second, even with like some extra stuff, it's still in\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:25.539\r\nFrancis: But what instead we should do is use it to transform our own words. Right? So\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:31.269\r\nFrancis: if you don't know, chat, gpt, the Gpt. Stands for.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.430\r\nFrancis: Oh, my God! I forgot\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:51.799\r\nFrancis: something. General purpose, transformer right keyword, there being transformer, it transforms one thing into another. It transforms your input into what it thinks is the desired output, right? So the reason that AI gets\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:32:52.050 --> 00:33:08.580\r\nFrancis: harped on for having this like soulless generic content. That it writes is because you give it soulless generic inputs, right like there's no, there's nothing. There's nothing in this right. There's no soul in this. There's nothing about me in here that\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:27.839\r\nFrancis: you could feel like right if you knew me, and like knew the content. I wrote for myself, read my Facebook page, saw my Instagram videos. Things like that. You would read this and be like that doesn't sound like Fran like that's not. That's not. That's not him at all right. But I didn't give it anything about me. I didn't.\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:41.079\r\nFrancis: But if you start with like here, my system is set up so that it takes\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:33:42.742 --> 00:33:44.520\r\nFrancis: where is it?\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.339\r\nFrancis: Right? It'll take the transcript\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:57.099\r\nFrancis: from one of these and turns that into\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.309\r\nFrancis: into different pieces of content. Right? So it takes my own words\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:11.989\r\nFrancis: and turns into the content. Right? So it has something about me. It knows something about me, and that's what makes\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:21.909\r\nFrancis: AI really cool and powerful, plus then you can just get into like the content multiplication we'll get into that in just a second. So this is\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.969\r\nFrancis: the second draft, and you worry about that.\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.270\r\nFrancis: you'll see this is a much longer conversation. So\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:42.599\r\nFrancis: I started the conversation. My everyday OS content Creator Project, which has that background? Info about me. That more extensive prompt.\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.840\r\nFrancis: And is that how you spell rubric?\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.730\r\nFrancis: Hmm!\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:54.230\r\nFrancis: Learn something new every day. So yeah, basically, all I did took this output here.\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:15.860\r\nFrancis: I said, I need you to analyze the attached piece of content that had written by an Llm. And tell me all the ways in which it sucks and needs to be improved, especially as far as the hook and lead go. We need that to be a lot more interesting and just generally make it more on Brand. First, st I need to grade out rubric, then find the ways that we can improve it whoops\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.710\r\nFrancis: so no, my gosh.\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:35:23.707 --> 00:35:28.782\r\nFrancis: those are. Those are totally relevant for what we're doing here. So don't worry about that\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.580\r\nFrancis: So one thing that I think it would be\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.120\r\nFrancis: a really good exercise to do\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:54.439\r\nFrancis: if you're just learning about AI, and how to talk to it is come up with some sort of content, grading rubric based on whatever matters to you. Right like.\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:35:55.290 --> 00:36:10.010\r\nFrancis: I will work on a prompt that is more of like a specific copy chief that has more instructions on how I want to grade it. But for now, just like, for the example of this.\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:16.699\r\nFrancis: whatever rubric is fine, and I was actually pretty impressed with this as I read through it, because\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:37.874\r\nFrancis: I was much, much nicer to the output from this than this was right like I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good, like much better than I thought it was. Gonna be. I'm like, you know, it's nothing amazing. It's nothing amazing. But I'm like, shit. I'll post it just to see what happens.\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:46.680\r\nFrancis: and then I start re they send through here and start reading this and go grade d plus 38 out of 100. And\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.089\r\nFrancis: what that showed me\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:36:49.610 --> 00:37:18.680\r\nFrancis: really kind of plainly is like my own biases towards AI. Right like I'm very pro AI is really changed my life in the last 2 years, and helped me in so many ways. I've been struggling with like my copy career. It also is like already taken my job more or less to the point where, like, I've spent the last 2 years learning automation and basic computer programming. So that like, I can create systems like this instead of\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:37:19.424 --> 00:37:21.880\r\nFrancis: losing clients to AI.\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.320\r\nFrancis: But\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:42.239\r\nFrancis: so what that means because humans always have biases and egos. I wanted to be. And this this is all like, I went. I went through this, live in the last video that I forgot to record. So make sure you hit record creators.\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.279\r\nFrancis: And\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:54.590\r\nFrancis: I went through this live. And it really made me realize like, oh, dang like, because I want other people to be as excited about AI as I am.\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:06.970\r\nFrancis: I want to kind of like talk this up more so that people get more excited. And be like, Oh, yeah, that's really not that bad, right? Because we're very influenced.\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:38:07.703 --> 00:38:17.950\r\nFrancis: And very influential creatures, right? It's easy for us to like influence and get excited about things like based on what other people say or prior experiences. Blah blah!\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.729\r\nFrancis: But when I told AI,\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:36.579\r\nFrancis: tell me all the ways in which this sucks right, and it doesn't care. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't, you know. Like, if I would take this back to a copywriter if a client would like. Come back to me and be like, Hey.\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.150\r\nFrancis: not bad. But now I want you to like. Find all the ways, sucks.\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:46.829\r\nFrancis: and like everything that you can do to improve it. I'm like, Oh, my God, really! Are you fucking? Kidding me like\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:38:47.190 --> 00:39:07.339\r\nFrancis: no, yeah, it doesn't care. And if I didn't like this like I could have a redo it. You know a lot of times I will change this 1st prompt like 4, 5, 6 times before continuing on the conversation. You know, just taking different things. I've learned from this right? So maybe\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:16.498\r\nFrancis: right like, let's see, what is the rubric we have hook, brand, alignment, content, quality, audience, resonance. Cta,\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.290\r\nFrancis: and we can, I mean shit. Let's even just extensive rubric\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.109\r\nFrancis: experienced copy. Chief.\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.829\r\nFrancis: Let's update and see that.\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.535\r\nFrancis: Oh.\r\n\r\n256\r\n00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.635\r\nFrancis: and while it's doing all this\r\n\r\n257\r\n00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:31.065\r\nFrancis: to go back to you know an easy way to learn to use AI or like understand AI better is to do different like grading rubrics. And if you come up with like either rubric that you already use, or, you know, go, look something up and kind of modify that for your purposes, and then kind of feed that into AI with either like content that you've made in the past.\r\n\r\n258\r\n00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:37.620\r\nFrancis: you know something you're making right now, and just be like, Hey, analyze this based on the rubric, and tell me which ways it can improve right?\r\n\r\n259\r\n00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:47.020\r\nFrancis: And that's a good way to start to understand how AI is looking at your content and thinking about it.\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:57.630\r\nFrancis: and then you can also, too, like you know, there, there are things that I struggle with. Still, right. I've written millions and millions of words, but there's certain things that I\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:02.570\r\nFrancis: don't do well because of how I think about the world, and having\r\n\r\n262\r\n00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:15.170\r\nFrancis: an AI rubric in here kind of great, and be like making sure like, Hey, is this hook actually interesting, right? Like, will this be interesting to everybody else, or just to me?\r\n\r\n263\r\n00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.753\r\nFrancis: So stuff like that. So let's see, we'll go through\r\n\r\n264\r\n00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.089\r\nFrancis: Go through here content, analysis, custom, analysis, framework, right? And that could be something.\r\n\r\n265\r\n00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.400\r\nFrancis: Here, let's do this.\r\n\r\n266\r\n00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.109\r\nFrancis: Please give me the full and complete, detailed, prompt.\r\n\r\n267\r\n00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:40.360\r\nFrancis: that you came up with slash created to do this rubric grading analysis\r\n\r\n268\r\n00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.399\r\nFrancis: that screwed up\r\n\r\n269\r\n00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:57.430\r\nFrancis: one to do. Oh, there we go!\r\n\r\n270\r\n00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:07.189\r\nFrancis: Whisper, whisper, flow has been weird about stopping. So we'll do that while we go through here. So great d plus all right\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:11.810\r\nFrancis: detail, rubric assessment hook and lead 5 out of 20\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:20.050\r\nFrancis: generic. I just watched opening, tired, overused fake relatability play with the scream Emoji\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:26.180\r\nFrancis: 0 pattern, interrupt or curiosity. App takes 4 paragraphs to get to any value, like\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:37.960\r\nFrancis: no unique angle or fresh perspective like this harsh stuff. Right? Could you imagine sitting here and having someone like grade your work like this brand alignment. 3 out of 20. Vital\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.640\r\nFrancis: didn't know anything about my brand. So of course, like.\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:47.269\r\nFrancis: it's not going to like, it's going to fail this like horrifically\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:57.419\r\nFrancis: but it just kind of goes to show that like, if you write a piece of content and you have a brand kit with it like you can include that in\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.209\r\nFrancis: your your content, like, you know. Like, if you're a freelancer.\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:12.410\r\nFrancis: write copy for clients like Create brand kit for a client, and then use AI to make sure that whatever you write for them like follows like on brand right?\r\n\r\n280\r\n00:43:13.538 --> 00:43:40.830\r\nFrancis: So missing all this, which no kidding structure and flow 8 out of 15 uses. Line breaks and format. That's that's a bit, but must have right. Must have done it well. Wall of text and nice sections. No, but therefore transition as required, that's part of my brand. So I highly recommend looking into the careers of South Park. They've got a great little video on Youtube like called Story Structure.\r\n\r\n281\r\n00:43:41.551 --> 00:43:44.990\r\nFrancis: You know, it's just Youtube, like, how\r\n\r\n282\r\n00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:51.429\r\nFrancis: like South Park story structure or something like that, my Youtube's blocked right now because it's gonna focus\r\n\r\n283\r\n00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:58.600\r\nFrancis: But they have this great, this great philosophy that if you can say, and then\r\n\r\n284\r\n00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:10.309\r\nFrancis: between different beats of a story. You know, different section scenes of a story you've got a pretty boring story it should be filled with, but and therefore right. So it's like.\r\n\r\n285\r\n00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:15.019\r\nFrancis: I spent the entire\r\n\r\n286\r\n00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:27.410\r\nFrancis: week coming up with all these prompts that I thought was going to help have AI create the best content for me. But after I saw the 1st thing it put out.\r\n\r\n287\r\n00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.319\r\nFrancis: I just\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:34.469\r\nFrancis: wanted to walk away from this whole thing. I I don't know like that was, that was not a good thing, but\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:39.660\r\nFrancis: you get the idea, the the but is to kind of\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:48.090\r\nFrancis: something needs to happen right? Like we. We have to. We have to make sure that there, there's something happening that\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:55.679\r\nFrancis: is interesting and and interesting things are those that get in the way of\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:00.359\r\nFrancis: what we think. The obvious outcome should be right like if I'm starting to\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:11.790\r\nFrancis: a conversation of like, Oh, my God, I love AI. I've spent all this time creating these prompts, and you know, really poured my heart and soul into it. Been working on prompt engineering and stuff like that for a while.\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:17.199\r\nFrancis: But you're like, Oh, my God, what happened right? That's kind of what it is.\r\n\r\n295\r\n00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:26.239\r\nFrancis: Value delivery all sizzle. No steak doesn't teach anything right. I'm a big believer in teaching. First, st you know.\r\n\r\n296\r\n00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:41.030\r\nFrancis: You give value that way. No frameworks, prompts or actionable tactics list benefits clearly doesn't demonstrate expertise just claims it. That's a big thing that's kind of included in my brain. Kids like show. Don't tell\r\n\r\n297\r\n00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.190\r\nFrancis: psychological triggers. Fomo is present. Social proof attempt, though generic.\r\n\r\n298\r\n00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:53.964\r\nFrancis: right? Fake scarcity, only 10 coaches. This is the one I'd like push back on a little bit.\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:13.569\r\nFrancis: simply because, like the way I run this like I, I'm working with clients on their prompts a lot. So I do. Do limit it. Pushy cta! Despite claiming no pushy tactics. Let me see here, what is the Cta.\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.530\r\nFrancis: Let's see if you're done with, and you're ready for\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:31.319\r\nFrancis: I mean I don't know if I'd call it called this pushy\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:46:32.286 --> 00:46:38.949\r\nFrancis: so it might be a little little over the top on that one, but still right like, if we can prove it, we can prove it.\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:45.479\r\nFrancis: Originally it could be written by any automation service cookie, cutter, coach marking template, drop\r\n\r\n304\r\n00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.570\r\nFrancis: seriously in 2025 right\r\n\r\n305\r\n00:46:48.790 --> 00:47:01.470\r\nFrancis: Ps. Structure is painfully predictable. Credibility. 5 out of 10 fake claims without specifics. Last week story feels manufactured right totally is numbers, provided no mention of actual tech process.\r\n\r\n306\r\n00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:06.450\r\nFrancis: real truth. What sucks the most right like.\r\n\r\n307\r\n00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:14.080\r\nFrancis: even if you had like an editor, you know you're working working at bigger copy place, or you know, you hire a copy coach like\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.060\r\nFrancis: it's often hard for people to give this sort of like\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:40.029\r\nFrancis: direct feedback. And personally, like, I like direct feedback like this, right? Like, I don't need things sugarcoat like. Just tell me what's wrong, and like we can start to fix it like, is it gonna hurt? I'm gonna feel a little upset about it. Yes, but I'm a big boy. I'll get over it so like. I want it to talk to me like this. And if I you know\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.820\r\nFrancis: when I spend time creating a more detailed rubric.\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:51.249\r\nFrancis: then it will have even more clear instructions on how to do this. So like, let's just go over\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:47:51.470 --> 00:48:10.409\r\nFrancis: what we got here. What sucks the most. The opening is doa. I just watched a coach spend 4 h. This is the. It was a dark and stormy night of marketing copy. Every coach automation tool starts with a you're immediately forgettable. Right? And this is a good reminder. Right? This is a good reminder. I just watched, you know, like\r\n\r\n313\r\n00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:23.940\r\nFrancis: you are forgettable. And you need to know that emoji diarrhea. I like this. Your brand, Kit says sparingly. This post has 15 plus emojis. It looks like a 2019 Mlm. Pitch\r\n\r\n314\r\n00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:36.640\r\nFrancis: AI is starting to get funny. The fake, reluctant Guru voice. Here's the truth. Most Gurus won't tell you while writing exactly like every Guru, the irony is painful.\r\n\r\n315\r\n00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:50.430\r\nFrancis: Oh, this is good, this is really good, right? And and again, like this is without much context of like a rubric. I just like an extensive rubric and experienced copy chief or editor would use right?\r\n\r\n316\r\n00:48:52.260 --> 00:49:03.209\r\nFrancis: 0 demonstration of expertise. You claim to be tech savvy, but never mentioned what Amls use, how automation actually works specific tools or workflows any technical insight whatsoever.\r\n\r\n317\r\n00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:12.389\r\nFrancis: Right? And this is good feedback but also not exactly accurate. And this comes back to the context of like.\r\n\r\n318\r\n00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:20.649\r\nFrancis: what demonstration of expertise means in this context? Right? Because coaches\r\n\r\n319\r\n00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:34.909\r\nFrancis: probably don't care that much about what AI model I use. How the automation actually works like, no one wants me to come in and start explaining what all these different nodes do right? Like\r\n\r\n320\r\n00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.490\r\nFrancis: I.\r\n\r\n321\r\n00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:45.550\r\nFrancis: All this stuff. And a lot of this. And a lot of this is just Bs stuff that you don't need to know. It's like prep stuff, right? It's this, make sure that we have\r\n\r\n322\r\n00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:55.330\r\nFrancis: the files we need. Right? This, make sure we have the context. We need looks for clips.\r\n\r\n323\r\n00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:03.250\r\nFrancis: This one formats it right, then brings it back through here to edit again, then formats it again.\r\n\r\n324\r\n00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:09.370\r\nFrancis: Then to, you know, so like all this, all this stuff that you don't no one cares about right.\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.260\r\nFrancis: But what we do want to demonstrate\r\n\r\n326\r\n00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:22.860\r\nFrancis: and show of expertise, you know, would be more along the lines of that. We understand\r\n\r\n327\r\n00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:40.627\r\nFrancis: how to leverage AI to fill those content gaps that most coaches, you know, are falling into right, whether you don't have the extra budget to hire a big content team that can edit all your videos. Right? You know. So like most coaches,\r\n\r\n328\r\n00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.009\r\nFrancis: likely can hire an editor that might edit what\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.490\r\nFrancis: one video a week, 2 videos a week, something like that.\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.620\r\nFrancis: Not 10.\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:50:51.330 --> 00:51:07.310\r\nFrancis: Right? But AI, let's do 10 videos a week. Let's do every single video. For you know, fraction of the price. So showing how you can take AI use different prompts things like that to really\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:15.589\r\nFrancis: leverage your content output and test a bunch of different things like that's how I would talk about like demonstrating expertise\r\n\r\n333\r\n00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:23.609\r\nFrancis: generic benefits list. Very true, the fair warning section. This might feel like cheating cringe. This is 2015 copywriting.\r\n\r\n334\r\n00:51:24.189 --> 00:51:36.050\r\nFrancis: Fake scarcity. Again, I would. Your brand is about democratizing. AI, not false exclusivity. Okay, this is a really great point. Right? So I would, you know, like I\r\n\r\n335\r\n00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:41.549\r\nFrancis: I would push back on this for sure. Still.\r\n\r\n336\r\n00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:49.769\r\nFrancis: because I do think 10 is real and legitimate, you know, onboarding more than 10 people\r\n\r\n337\r\n00:51:49.790 --> 00:52:09.710\r\nFrancis: with the system right now. It does still take a minute to set up, and you know it is an ongoing thing at the moment to keep improving, and stuff like that. So like I would do, I would say 10 is good, but it brings up a good point. Your brand is about democratizing AI, not false exclusivity. So that would\r\n\r\n338\r\n00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:21.629\r\nFrancis: tell me what I should be doing in that line is a better job of explaining why there are only 10 spots available which can also help boost\r\n\r\n339\r\n00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:30.149\r\nFrancis: credibility and likelihood of someone saying, Yes, because, you know, the reason is is that I give more time and attention.\r\n\r\n340\r\n00:52:30.738 --> 00:52:46.510\r\nFrancis: To people. And that's another cool thing about like AI, and what it will allow us to do, as far as like making money. I don't like managing people. I've done it both in retail settings like face to face. And for different, like\r\n\r\n341\r\n00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.510\r\nFrancis: online companies I've worked with.\r\n\r\n342\r\n00:52:51.150 --> 00:53:02.490\r\nFrancis: And I just don't like managing people period. I don't want to manage people. I want to do as much as I can as a sole entrepreneur, which obviously means that there will be caps in\r\n\r\n343\r\n00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:32.419\r\nFrancis: what I can do. Income! I can make things like that. But at the end of the day I'm not willing to make those sacrifices in quality and customer service that you know you just have to, as you scale and hire other people and do stuff like that's not something I want to do like. I want to be in the trenches like building things, working on clients stuff and make it better and better. Right? I love. I love writing. I love writing, and I love being able to produce cool content.\r\n\r\n344\r\n00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.889\r\nFrancis: more, better, faster with AI. So\r\n\r\n345\r\n00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.990\r\nFrancis: that's what I want to do. And this is very real. This is very real right now, and 10 people\r\n\r\n346\r\n00:53:41.692 --> 00:53:44.650\r\nFrancis: in the next month here. So\r\n\r\n347\r\n00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.750\r\nFrancis: I need to just give it some more context\r\n\r\n348\r\n00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.840\r\nFrancis: how to fix this mess. All right.\r\n\r\n349\r\n00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:58.740\r\nFrancis: new hook options. Let's see option. A technical entry. Yesterday I fed a 47 min zoom recording to Gpt. 4 with a 2.\r\n\r\n350\r\n00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:04.487\r\nFrancis: I mean, that's like super specific. What happened next broke my content calendar in the best way.\r\n\r\n351\r\n00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:12.599\r\nFrancis: Right? So if I was making content more, maybe for like automation\r\n\r\n352\r\n00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:18.950\r\nFrancis: people right like, if my goal was to sell this like specifically to like other automation.\r\n\r\n353\r\n00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:38.149\r\nFrancis: people who just want like a plug and play system that they can learn how to install for clients like I might. I might go with this one option B. Contrarian data coaches who post daily make 40% less than coaches, who post twice a week unless they're using this one prompt system that I\r\n\r\n354\r\n00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.129\r\nFrancis: I don't like that one. That one just sounds stupid like\r\n\r\n355\r\n00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:47.839\r\nFrancis: if you post more like, you're probably going to do better than someone who posts twice a week. So\r\n\r\n356\r\n00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.900\r\nFrancis: AI doesn't always get it. Story with specifics.\r\n\r\n357\r\n00:54:52.590 --> 00:55:01.120\r\nFrancis: France just turned one zoom call into force and piece content, using 3 chat gpt prompts and a Google sheet time invested 8 min. Here's the exact workflow\r\n\r\n358\r\n00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:10.229\r\nFrancis: again. Not that great. It's funny. I actually got a lot better responses from the\r\n\r\n359\r\n00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.820\r\nFrancis: last, the last one which I'll show you in a second.\r\n\r\n360\r\n00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:25.969\r\nFrancis: Alright we got for voice fixes. Now kill every emoji yup and technical specifics maybe\r\n\r\n361\r\n00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.039\r\nFrancis: release one actual, prompt or framework.\r\n\r\n362\r\n00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.850\r\nFrancis: It's actually not a terrible idea. It's actually not a terrible idea. Maybe what I do is like\r\n\r\n363\r\n00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.149\r\nFrancis: link to\r\n\r\n364\r\n00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:47.490\r\nFrancis: I don't know like I could. If you know, if I want to go like the extra mile I could link to like a meta prompt so that people can like\r\n\r\n365\r\n00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:54.910\r\nFrancis: create their own brand. Kit. Kind of thing, reference, and atlas a bit subtly. These are.\r\n\r\n366\r\n00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.350\r\nFrancis: I have some characters like I'm playing with. I need to redo this\r\n\r\n367\r\n00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:05.290\r\nFrancis: because I don't quite like the characters as they are. But I like the idea of having characters in my content.\r\n\r\n368\r\n00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:14.150\r\nFrancis: You sure paragraphs? Yup. Current ones are novels, I mean, are they really\r\n\r\n369\r\n00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:18.950\r\nFrancis: alright.\r\n\r\n370\r\n00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:26.367\r\nFrancis: I guess. Depending. Yeah, I mean, like, if you consider all this like one paragraph and social media, right?\r\n\r\n371\r\n00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:38.620\r\nFrancis: structure, overhaul. Yep, yep, get value in 51st words show the system, don't just promise it. Include a mini tutorial, prompt.\r\n\r\n372\r\n00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.860\r\nFrancis: Make a Cta about learning, not buying\r\n\r\n373\r\n00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:58.430\r\nFrancis: brand align reframe instead of coach struggling with content position as explored, discovering untapped content. Gold in their zoom. Vault fits your adventure theme. Perfectly right. So here's here's something that's like kind of really worth mentioning like, why\r\n\r\n374\r\n00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:04.249\r\nFrancis: gain your brand kit? Right? Is important. I don't think this is something.\r\n\r\n375\r\n00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.630\r\nFrancis: Wait! What's that like?\r\n\r\n376\r\n00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:22.310\r\nFrancis: I am not like Brand was never a big thing for me, most of my career. It's only been the last couple of years that I've really started to be like. Oh, damn! I really kind of screwed that one up, not building more of a brand\r\n\r\n377\r\n00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:39.899\r\nFrancis: But here, like explore discovering untapped content and gold in their zoom vault fits your adventure theme perfectly. That was my 1st idea of what I want to do for my brand kit and my brand, and what I've kind of been playing with like. Here, let's\r\n\r\n378\r\n00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:46.259\r\nFrancis: see, right? So it creates stuff like this.\r\n\r\n379\r\n00:57:49.240 --> 00:58:01.469\r\nFrancis: I would say. This is probably my favorite of all of them. Right. I have a few different themes. I wanted to try try out a few different things, so like I've been playing with what I want for\r\n\r\n380\r\n00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:13.477\r\nFrancis: brand stuff quite a bit. And now I just need to come back and kind of like solidify it. But, like overall, I've not been totally digging these characters.\r\n\r\n381\r\n00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.999\r\nFrancis: so we'll go back through and fix it. And that's the cool thing with AI, too. Right? Like, I can\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:28.259\r\nFrancis: create multiple different brands. And that's actually like, kind of what I'm going to be doing with another series is creating just new\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:35.700\r\nFrancis: brand accounts of I don't know different topics and things like that, and start creating content and growing those channels just for\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.871\r\nFrancis: shits and giggles and proof of concept\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:54.260\r\nFrancis: And I don't. I don't want to do the explore discovering untapped content, golden or zoom vaults, like as I read, I'm like, that sounds kind of cringey. We're gonna have to give some different details there.\r\n\r\n386\r\n00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:11.590\r\nFrancis: Bottom line. This reads like every coach to coach pitch from 2020. Your brain is about pragmatic tech, savvy empowerment with playful challenger voice. This post is neither pragmatic nor playful playful. It's just pushy. Start over with your actual expertise, the technical how to\r\n\r\n387\r\n00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.849\r\nFrancis: that. Others won't share. Right. So\r\n\r\n388\r\n00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:19.120\r\nFrancis: we're gonna go back to the other conversation in just a second. But I do want to\r\n\r\n389\r\n00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:29.460\r\nFrancis: kind of show you how Claude, being such a good agentic model, and, if you remember, from here\r\n\r\n390\r\n00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:35.080\r\nFrancis: we had search for matching prompts, select a prompt\r\n\r\n391\r\n00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:37.510\r\nFrancis: create, a custom, prompt if needed.\r\n\r\n392\r\n00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:44.630\r\nFrancis: and then execute, execute the transformation right? And if we look, this prompt\r\n\r\n393\r\n00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.010\r\nFrancis: a lot longer than I thought is very clearly not\r\n\r\n394\r\n00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:58.130\r\nFrancis: not in here. You are, bell hardened copy, chief, with 25 years experience. Right? Let's see.\r\n\r\n395\r\n01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:09.799\r\nFrancis: Oh, Video, blueprint builder. So we've got copy chief here. But that's as far as like videos go.\r\n\r\n396\r\n01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:15.279\r\nFrancis: What's right now, that's the Xml version. Yeah. So I mean, like, we don't have this prompt\r\n\r\n397\r\n01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:23.869\r\nFrancis: in here, this created this create, this prompt and basically use it. What was it? This exact specific, prompt? It used\r\n\r\n398\r\n01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:31.480\r\nFrancis: when it came up with this 1st one? I don't know if we look through here.\r\n\r\n399\r\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:42.670\r\nFrancis: let's see from the brand kit, right? So like pulled stuff from the brand Kit key issues, I'm already seeing generic Guru, right? So it's not following this like specific\r\n\r\n400\r\n01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:49.680\r\nFrancis: brand below. And that's why, again, it's important to use prompts. But if\r\n\r\n401\r\n01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.989\r\nFrancis: if I want, if I really like this, want to use this for other content.\r\n\r\n402\r\n01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:56.580\r\nFrancis: now I have the prompt right?\r\n\r\n403\r\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.700\r\nFrancis: I have version one of this.\r\n\r\n404\r\n01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.160\r\nFrancis: I can look through it. And anything that like, you know. Let's see\r\n\r\n405\r\n01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.650\r\nFrancis: hook and lead 20 points values 1st 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n406\r\n01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:23.610\r\nFrancis: you know, I might change this from 3 seconds to 3 sentences. Right? Since it'll have a better idea of like a sentence versus the seconds. Here pattern interrupt. Is it unexpected, fresh, right? I would probably like detail\r\n\r\n407\r\n01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.440\r\nFrancis: this out more and be like, what does unexpected fresh mean\r\n\r\n408\r\n01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.150\r\nFrancis: in the context of, you know.\r\n\r\n409\r\n01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:38.540\r\nFrancis: coaching online education, Curia Gap. What question does it create, you know, might give some examples here. Things like that. So\r\n\r\n410\r\n01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.690\r\nFrancis: this gives you a really really good place to start.\r\n\r\n411\r\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.759\r\nFrancis: and you can keep working from there. And now\r\n\r\n412\r\n01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.285\r\nFrancis: this is the 1st one, right? And this is pretty similar.\r\n\r\n413\r\n01:01:55.870 --> 01:02:04.460\r\nFrancis: I actually liked. I like this rubric better than the second one generic. I watch someone waste time openings your intrigue.\r\n\r\n414\r\n01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.629\r\nFrancis: You don't really need to go.\r\n\r\n415\r\n01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:17.369\r\nFrancis: Oh, this is good, right? Some valid points identified, benefits clearly listed, though generic logical flow exists.\r\n\r\n416\r\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:31.140\r\nFrancis: But during cliches and emoji spam blah blah critical issues, right? This. This focused a little bit better on the hook and opening and gave me some different suggestions this way.\r\n\r\n417\r\n01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:37.920\r\nFrancis: Right? So redemption path rather than creating a\r\n\r\n418\r\n01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.250\r\nFrancis: a whole new post right away.\r\n\r\n419\r\n01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:43.960\r\nFrancis: This focus, like I said on the hooks. Better\r\n\r\n420\r\n01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:49.980\r\nFrancis: option. One parent interrupt your zoom. Recurrents are worth $47,000. You just don't know it yet.\r\n\r\n421\r\n01:02:50.130 --> 01:03:03.270\r\nFrancis: This could be good if it was true, right? It obviously took it from the original post which is assumed to be true. But I don't. I don't have anything to back up the $47,000 yet. I could\r\n\r\n422\r\n01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:09.250\r\nFrancis: take this as painting kind of a scenario or situation showing how.\r\n\r\n423\r\n01:03:09.983 --> 01:03:14.140\r\nFrancis: You know either a case study about how\r\n\r\n424\r\n01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:21.309\r\nFrancis: a client made more money, and you know, updated to the appropriate number. Another way is just like\r\n\r\n425\r\n01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:26.099\r\nFrancis: painting a picture of like, Hey, this is how like\r\n\r\n426\r\n01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:34.049\r\nFrancis: your zoom recordings have all this extra content. If you post more content, you're gonna probably get more clients, you know, like extrapolate your current.\r\n\r\n427\r\n01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:44.099\r\nFrancis: kpis Roi's from your content now and like, let's say, that holds. But you start producing 10 times the amount of content, you know, like\r\n\r\n428\r\n01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.080\r\nFrancis: you go route like routes like that.\r\n\r\n429\r\n01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.400\r\nFrancis: I like this one\r\n\r\n430\r\n01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:02.010\r\nFrancis: last Tuesday bit, analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot does it now? Right? That's kind of a nice fun.\r\n\r\n431\r\n01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:19.560\r\nFrancis: But therefore, type of thing, it's not a true but it does, however, have that kind of contrast there. It's like, oh, I create an automation content automation system. But I'm done creating content forever. Like, what? What do you mean? So\r\n\r\n432\r\n01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:30.859\r\nFrancis: I might excuse me, you know. Maybe something changed changing this or adding to it where it'd be like.\r\n\r\n433\r\n01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:40.900\r\nFrancis: Last Tuesday, after finishing my content automation system and having bit analyzed my coaching calls, found something that made me quit creating content forever.\r\n\r\n434\r\n01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.410\r\nFrancis: I don't know something like that.\r\n\r\n435\r\n01:04:44.563 --> 01:04:45.850\r\nFrancis: And that's\r\n\r\n436\r\n01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:52.589\r\nFrancis: something I'll come back to in just a second after we go through option. 3. The Contrarian tooth. I like this one a lot.\r\n\r\n437\r\n01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.599\r\nFrancis: This is very much\r\n\r\n438\r\n01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:59.239\r\nFrancis: more me and my style, and like how I like to talk and talk to people.\r\n\r\n439\r\n01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:05.260\r\nFrancis: Stop creating content seriously. Stop what your conversations do instead.\r\n\r\n440\r\n01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:16.400\r\nFrancis: So it gives some good stuff, right? And again, this is all based on my brand kit, and if I don't like this you know, I can add stuff to my brand kit to get\r\n\r\n441\r\n01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:25.510\r\nFrancis: to get closer. I want just like, if I was working with contractor Va employee agency each time that we\r\n\r\n442\r\n01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:36.440\r\nFrancis: go through and create new content, you know, like they're updating their files. And you're like, Okay, we like this. We don't like that like this. Don't like that. Do the same thing with AI.\r\n\r\n443\r\n01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:42.249\r\nFrancis: See, Brand align, we don't really well.\r\n\r\n444\r\n01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.370\r\nFrancis: don't really need to go through all this stuff.\r\n\r\n445\r\n01:05:49.220 --> 01:06:00.040\r\nFrancis: Kind of similar to the last one with the critiques. But you know, just start with impossible sign claim use. But therefore, Max, 3 sentences per sections your decorative language.\r\n\r\n446\r\n01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:17.429\r\nFrancis: Oh, these were funny challenge. Don't coddle. You're either automating or you're cosplaying as va like this actually made me laugh out loud the 1st time. I don't know if y'all find it funny. But I do. I'm trying to get AI to put a little more humor\r\n\r\n447\r\n01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.710\r\nFrancis: into it.\r\n\r\n448\r\n01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.189\r\nFrancis: Your competitors use system. You use hope, it's a little bit too, on the nose.\r\n\r\n449\r\n01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:39.040\r\nFrancis: Every manual post is a choice to stay small. That one's kind of funny, too. Like if you could work that in a little bit differently, I think that could could be a funny. A funny thing I feel like this would be.\r\n\r\n450\r\n01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:42.040\r\nFrancis: Hmm!\r\n\r\n451\r\n01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:49.559\r\nFrancis: You would almost like I could see this being fun as like a parody of like a bro marketing\r\n\r\n452\r\n01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.650\r\nFrancis: thing, you know, like.\r\n\r\n453\r\n01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:58.379\r\nFrancis: have a guy pretending to be like super Bro and buff, be like every manual post, is a choice to stay small.\r\n\r\n454\r\n01:06:59.303 --> 01:07:03.430\r\nFrancis: You know, kind of like one of those bodybuilder type things anyways.\r\n\r\n455\r\n01:07:04.929 --> 01:07:07.889\r\nFrancis: So this we're just gonna kind of like, totally skip over.\r\n\r\n456\r\n01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.940\r\nFrancis: It it my\r\n\r\n457\r\n01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:21.590\r\nFrancis: part of my direction. The brand kit is like. I like to keep things concise. Economy of words, you know. Don't use fluff stuff like that, and\r\n\r\n458\r\n01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.820\r\nFrancis: I should specify this out a bit more.\r\n\r\n459\r\n01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.610\r\nFrancis: because I don't want, you know, like is\r\n\r\n460\r\n01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:43.770\r\nFrancis: too short. Right? It's it's interpreting what I meant by concise incorrectly, and again, like as I was kind of looking through my brand kit, I'm not 100% sure\r\n\r\n461\r\n01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:51.232\r\nFrancis: where, how or what is causing it to do that in here\r\n\r\n462\r\n01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.140\r\nFrancis: ruthless edits probably would be part of it.\r\n\r\n463\r\n01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:57.840\r\nFrancis: Pragmatic.\r\n\r\n464\r\n01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:11.810\r\nFrancis: Yeah, I think you know some of those some of those might do it. But and also, too, like I didn't want a paragraph post right? It just didn't know from the 1st\r\n\r\n465\r\n01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:16.379\r\nFrancis: conversation over here where I asked for\r\n\r\n466\r\n01:08:17.216 --> 01:08:28.500\r\nFrancis: the long form specifically right. It's telling me here's a compelling long form, but this doesn't know that I wanted long form. It just knows I got a long form. So it's like, Oh, we should shorten this\r\n\r\n467\r\n01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:31.680\r\nFrancis: next steps.\r\n\r\n468\r\n01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:38.080\r\nFrancis: Here's some of the rewrites, I'm like, okay, sure fine, but that's not exactly it.\r\n\r\n469\r\n01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:47.749\r\nFrancis: And what I like to do. And this has been a complete game changer with whisper, whisper, flow, now is you just\r\n\r\n470\r\n01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:53.520\r\nFrancis: start the conversation right? So, you know, do the fn and spacebar.\r\n\r\n471\r\n01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.069\r\nFrancis: and go back through this prompt\r\n\r\n472\r\n01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.130\r\nFrancis: and just talk through what I like, what I don't like what I agree with, what I disagree with\r\n\r\n473\r\n01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:08.370\r\nFrancis: anything I want changed stuff like that.\r\n\r\n474\r\n01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:14.969\r\nFrancis: right? And look at this. Look at this context like this was just for me talking, you know, and imagine, like\r\n\r\n475\r\n01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:24.329\r\nFrancis: most people just like typing this out aren't going to type this much, just, you know, simply because, like it's\r\n\r\n476\r\n01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.560\r\nFrancis: take a while, takes a minute\r\n\r\n477\r\n01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:46.019\r\nFrancis: but instead, like, I can just talk through all this and just be like I like this part. I don't like that part. This is kind of what I'm going for. Blah blah blah! And then and then a little little hack little secret that I love to use and finish off\r\n\r\n478\r\n01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:49.580\r\nFrancis: a lot of my prompts with is.\r\n\r\n479\r\n01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:53.399\r\nFrancis: ask me any follow-up questions. Come on.\r\n\r\n480\r\n01:09:53.520 --> 01:10:01.279\r\nFrancis: ask me any. Follow up questions you need to in order to be 90% confident, you can make the necessary updates\r\n\r\n481\r\n01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:16.723\r\nFrancis: to really make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like this for them. So the important part is, ask me questions until you're 90% confident you can effect. Can dot dot right?\r\n\r\n482\r\n01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:24.849\r\nFrancis: don't go above 90 do like 80% if you want to. But like 80, 90% is good, anything above 90, it just gets like\r\n\r\n483\r\n01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:36.030\r\nFrancis: too detailed. So what you're basically saying here is like, what contacts are you missing that you need\r\n\r\n484\r\n01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:48.639\r\nFrancis: to create the post I want? And if you gave it like some decent input before and tell you like, what your goal is, what you're trying to do things like that. And we'll get more into this into like conversation structure in the next video.\r\n\r\n485\r\n01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:52.140\r\nFrancis: But what it's\r\n\r\n486\r\n01:10:52.670 --> 01:11:07.410\r\nFrancis: what we're doing here is asking like, what other details do you need to know what are the things you know about me. To make this really good. And you can simply say, like to effectively, you know, 90% confident to effectively\r\n\r\n487\r\n01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:18.519\r\nFrancis: help me create this or finish this task, finish this project whatever like. I like being a little bit more explicit in these things because it does help\r\n\r\n488\r\n01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.779\r\nFrancis: kind of guide the AI and like what to think about right? Like\r\n\r\n489\r\n01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:51.419\r\nFrancis: 90% confident you can make the necessary updates to make. And I should take really out of there. But who cares to make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like that for them? Right. The ultimate goal that I want is an effective Facebook post that will help people have people reaching out to me. Right? So what do you need to know to be 90% confident that you can do that. Create that Facebook post.\r\n\r\n490\r\n01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:58.469\r\nFrancis: And it will ask right? It's not going to groan. It's not going to be like, oh, my God! You want me to rewrite it again, or do this again.\r\n\r\n491\r\n01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.790\r\nFrancis: So it was great feedback.\r\n\r\n492\r\n01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:17.239\r\nFrancis: I need to figure out like, well, I don't know this kind of feels nice, but you know, these being a helpful assistant, they can be a bit sycophantic. And will usually tell you. That's good, right? Otherwise. So you do have to take a\r\n\r\n493\r\n01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:26.740\r\nFrancis: bit of critical thinking and make sure it's actually right and not just blowing smoke up your ass. It's really important to do like, I don't recommend\r\n\r\n494\r\n01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:40.669\r\nFrancis: using AI to create content around subjects that you aren't familiar with, because it will do a really really good job writing something that is complete, 100% bullshit, or just like\r\n\r\n495\r\n01:12:40.870 --> 01:13:05.219\r\nFrancis: off the mark of what's kind of like, accurate and true. It'll sound really good and like, if you don't know, like the industry like, yeah, that that totally makes sense. But then you hand it to the client. They're like the this isn't right. You're like fuck. So just make sure that, like you do know what you're talking about. Before you have AI do it so you can proofread in that\r\n\r\n496\r\n01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.910\r\nFrancis: And then what I did in\r\n\r\n497\r\n01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.799\r\nFrancis: the last video that I didn't\r\n\r\n498\r\n01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:18.550\r\nFrancis: record is essentially took whisper flow like I talked about before.\r\n\r\n499\r\n01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:32.510\r\nFrancis: started it, and just read through these and just kind of answered the questions right and talk through this. You mentioned your accomplishments, writing 10 million words, any specific client transformations, your own content, metrics.\r\n\r\n500\r\n01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:36.955\r\nFrancis: real systems, metrics. Right? We don't need to go into this\r\n\r\n501\r\n01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:43.109\r\nFrancis: at the moment. It's probably a little bit too in depth, on, like how I think about things.\r\n\r\n502\r\n01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:51.849\r\nFrancis: But what you can see and what is important to point out here is because I use whisper, flow. Look at\r\n\r\n503\r\n01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:58.599\r\nFrancis: these answers right? Like this is a lot of context that I'm giving it\r\n\r\n504\r\n01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.349\r\nFrancis: and able to give it super easily, because all I did was start it. And then, just, you know, like, read through and brain dumped.\r\n\r\n505\r\n01:14:05.935 --> 01:14:10.989\r\nFrancis: Yeah, I'm like, no, this isn't right. I'd like this to do this instead. Blah blah.\r\n\r\n506\r\n01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.329\r\nFrancis: So it gives all that. And\r\n\r\n507\r\n01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:19.710\r\nFrancis: I haven't actually read the updated version yet. So let's we'll go through that together\r\n\r\n508\r\n01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.110\r\nFrancis: and see what what we come up with.\r\n\r\n509\r\n01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:31.479\r\nFrancis: So here we go 1st off quick, naming suggestions so like one of the things I did\r\n\r\n510\r\n01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:40.309\r\nFrancis: want to use, because, like, I don't want to do sales calls initially, or frame them as sales calls and don't\r\n\r\n511\r\n01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:51.710\r\nFrancis: I excuse me. I want to instead do it as a like brand Kit design type call where we help build out like their brand kit design kit.\r\n\r\n512\r\n01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:55.080\r\nFrancis: and then a minute, prompt that\r\n\r\n513\r\n01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.129\r\nFrancis: people can use and try it out and create content for them, and then have the sales call kind of thing. So\r\n\r\n514\r\n01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.449\r\nFrancis: ask for some naming ideas. I don't like voice mining call, but I do like content. DNA session.\r\n\r\n515\r\n01:15:09.425 --> 01:15:12.530\r\nFrancis: That's kind of a good one. The mining like.\r\n\r\n516\r\n01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:16.000\r\nFrancis: I don't know how I could get content.\r\n\r\n517\r\n01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:24.147\r\nFrancis: DNA mining I don't know but content set DNA session sounds pretty good. We can run with that\r\n\r\n518\r\n01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:35.280\r\nFrancis: version. One wake up, call level 10 sas, alright. Let's see. Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too. Really, quickly is tone calibration.\r\n\r\n519\r\n01:15:35.819 --> 01:15:47.800\r\nFrancis: I would definitely say, like my true authentic energy, is the 10 full. Wake up. You're doing everything wrong. Type of thing. I can be very to the point.\r\n\r\n520\r\n01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:57.149\r\nFrancis: and blunt in that respect with a bit of disregard, for like social norms, social conventions. And you know it's 1 of those things where.\r\n\r\n521\r\n01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.920\r\nFrancis: when you're creating content, you know I know the the\r\n\r\n522\r\n01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:12.259\r\nFrancis: trope is like, be authentic, be authentic and like yes, absolutely. But like, how authentic do you need to be in that like. I have a whole\r\n\r\n523\r\n01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:28.810\r\nFrancis: life outside of, like what I do here, and what I post that I don't talk about just because it's a not relevant and be like, not things that like I want to talk about right? Is that like inauthentic? I'm not sharing my entire life. I don't know, maybe, but you don't need to know that stuff right\r\n\r\n524\r\n01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.790\r\nFrancis: there. There is a specific business purpose.\r\n\r\n525\r\n01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:42.589\r\nFrancis: That I am creating this content for like, yes, I am trying to help people. So I do want to make sure that, like\r\n\r\n526\r\n01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:48.719\r\nFrancis: it catches their attention in a way that makes them open to receiving\r\n\r\n527\r\n01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:53.189\r\nFrancis: my ideas rather than just like\r\n\r\n528\r\n01:16:53.350 --> 01:17:10.296\r\nFrancis: shove in your face. You're doing wrong right? So we'll see what this full wake up. You're doing everything wrong, energy is. And then the other one I asked for like something that's more in like the 5 to 6 range, like a little. It's balanced, but it's just like a little tip towards\r\n\r\n529\r\n01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.960\r\nFrancis: towards the Sas here. So I'm curious to see\r\n\r\n530\r\n01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:17.627\r\nFrancis: what it does in that respect.\r\n\r\n531\r\n01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:33.670\r\nFrancis: you know, and kind of how it compares right? And that comes back to like your own, like understanding your own personal, like biases, flaws, worldviews and things like that. It's like knowing the ways in which you think about, and present yourself to the world that might not be\r\n\r\n532\r\n01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:41.519\r\nFrancis: effective, helpful, or beneficial to your bigger goals, you know, whether, again, like\r\n\r\n533\r\n01:17:42.180 --> 01:18:05.369\r\nFrancis: could be creating. You know, some sort of dollar value that you're looking for. It could be an impact. It could be a freedom, you know. That's the thing, I think, is really awesome about AI is more and more. People will have the ability to create lifestyle businesses. Right? You know, we, I think we're going to see kind of an end to the\r\n\r\n534\r\n01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:10.340\r\nFrancis: make millions of dollars in 90 day. Yeah, we're we're already seeing a lot of that like\r\n\r\n535\r\n01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.490\r\nFrancis: make money online stuff fizzle out. But I think it's going to\r\n\r\n536\r\n01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:31.590\r\nFrancis: come back even more. To the point where you will see a lot more people, you know, making just average income online, creating content about specific topics or things that they're interested account interested. On different accounts. Right?\r\n\r\n537\r\n01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:37.240\r\nFrancis: So we'll see more of that in the future. And\r\n\r\n538\r\n01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:49.850\r\nFrancis: where's I going with that one? I don't know. But oh, the the business purpose right? So like. Let's see what level 10 sas gets us. And if that's a little bit too over the top. So version one.\r\n\r\n539\r\n01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:50.870\r\nFrancis: oh.\r\n\r\n540\r\n01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.500\r\nFrancis: yeah, we'll get into this. We'll get this. I'll come back to that second stop creating content. Seriously. Stop!\r\n\r\n541\r\n01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:07.380\r\nFrancis: Let your conversation do it instead. Because right now you're cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running systems, and every manual post you create is a choice to stay small.\r\n\r\n542\r\n01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:10.260\r\nFrancis: harsh, good. Someone needs to say it.\r\n\r\n543\r\n01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:18.929\r\nFrancis: Last Tuesday bit analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot army handles it. Now.\r\n\r\n544\r\n01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:49.329\r\nFrancis: here's what bit discovered. You're performing the same conversation 5 times a week and creating 0 content from it. Meanwhile you're staring at Canva at 11 Pm. Trying to remember what font you used last time, Atlas, nearly short, circuited when he mapped out the ways. Think about it. Monday. Strategy session with a client gone. Tuesday group coaching masterclass, deleted Wednesday sales call where you drop your best framework banished. Thursday. Interview, where you explained your entire methodology. Poof!\r\n\r\n545\r\n01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:54.850\r\nFrancis: Friday workshop, where every set everyone said, mind blowing dust.\r\n\r\n546\r\n01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:04.609\r\nFrancis: 3 min of pure gold. 0 content cried. But you'll spend your weekend batching content. Aka! Panic cream, mediocre posts. I like that.\r\n\r\n547\r\n01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.690\r\nFrancis: You're either automating or you're larping as your own intern huh!\r\n\r\n548\r\n01:20:11.422 --> 01:20:16.069\r\nFrancis: Choose. I like that part a lot. I do like that.\r\n\r\n549\r\n01:20:16.758 --> 01:20:19.069\r\nFrancis: Here's what's actually insane.\r\n\r\n550\r\n01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:42.709\r\nFrancis: You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice. Every zoom call you do contains 12 to 15 story loops. Android chaperone will weep with joy. 8 to 10 contrarian insights. Your audience needs 20 quotable moments that would stop scrolls 3 to 5. Complete teaching frameworks. Enough email sequences to nurture leads for month\r\n\r\n551\r\n01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:47.549\r\nFrancis: within 1 h of hitting end meeting bidden Atlas can extract all of it.\r\n\r\n552\r\n01:20:47.760 --> 01:21:17.140\r\nFrancis: Bitmaps, narrative structure, atlas, cuts, formats, and deploys. You go have lunch. But Francis AI. Content is garbage. You're right. Those write viral posts with AI tools, absolute trash. I've tested them all. They pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration porn that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune cookie. I like this a lot. I don't know if you all think this is funny, but I am. I'm a fan.\r\n\r\n553\r\n01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:44.610\r\nFrancis: that's not what this is. Here's what separates this from every other AI content scam. I spent 10 years running over 10 million words that generated 10 million dollars in revenue for clients, real campaigns, real business, real money. I know it converts. And what's just noise. So I build your custom prompts. They're not templates. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. I like this. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice.\r\n\r\n554\r\n01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:58.290\r\nFrancis: We spend a session extracting your content. DNA. I build custom brand kits, design kits, and prompts your system, learns your frameworks, your language, your edge, then every one to 2 weeks we refine it together, because good enough is the enemy of extraordinary.\r\n\r\n555\r\n01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:10.132\r\nFrancis: The coaches who get this are already ahead. While you're finding your voice. They're everywhere. While you're planning content. They're closing deals while you're building consistency. They've already won.\r\n\r\n556\r\n01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.460\r\nFrancis: not because they're better coaches\r\n\r\n557\r\n01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:21.036\r\nFrancis: because they realize coaching calls are content. Creation, truth bomb. So this is like, well, all right. I'll come back to that.\r\n\r\n558\r\n01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:27.780\r\nFrancis: I so I want to read through all this before I start critiquing. It's really hard, though. Truth bomb.\r\n\r\n559\r\n01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:52.259\r\nFrancis: I built this system because I spent 4 years watching brilliant coaches fail, not because they couldn't coach, because they couldn't market, and I was tired of seeing mediocre coaches with great marketing eat their lunch. The world needs more good coaches, not more good marketers. So I built the bridge, upload your zoom, call, walk away, come back to 6 weeks of content, fair warning. I only take 10 clients per month.\r\n\r\n560\r\n01:22:52.360 --> 01:23:17.549\r\nFrancis: not fake scarcity, real bandwidth limits. Each client gets custom prompts personal refinement sessions, and my decade of experience baked into their system. That takes time. I refuse to dilute the quality. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out. We do a content. DNA session, not a sales call. I build your custom system during our call. You watch your own words become 30 pieces of content. You decide. If you want this power permanently.\r\n\r\n561\r\n01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:26.699\r\nFrancis: the session alone will change. How you think about content forever. You have 2 choices. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep falling behind. Keep watching others dominate your space.\r\n\r\n562\r\n01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:54.739\r\nFrancis: or let your conversations become your content. Empire DM me with, done with manual right now I'll send you examples of what bidden Atlas created from a single 37 min call your next zoom call is either tomorrow's content or tomorrow's regret. You decide Francis Ps. Still manually creating content in 2024. That's like handwriting, hand washing clothes when you own a washing machine, except the washing machine, also folds organized and delivers everything to your closet while you sleep.\r\n\r\n563\r\n01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.570\r\nFrancis: Alright. Alright! Alright!\r\n\r\n564\r\n01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.890\r\nFrancis: You know, as far as the Sas goes, and don't think that was too over the top, like. I don't\r\n\r\n565\r\n01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.590\r\nFrancis: think anything in there was really going to like turn someone off or piss them off.\r\n\r\n566\r\n01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:25.080\r\nFrancis: so I'm not sure how I feel about that. We'll see what version? 2 firm but fair level 5 to 6 sounds like. And then once I'm done\r\n\r\n567\r\n01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:35.902\r\nFrancis: reading this. We'll go back and talk about how I'd kind of critique and edit from here, because, like, I don't, these are not production ready yet.\r\n\r\n568\r\n01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:53.609\r\nFrancis: And and we want to get through these. And because right now, what I'm trying to do is show you that AI can write some pretty good content like this. It's still going to always sound a little bit off, because, like it's not quite your own words. But, as you can see.\r\n\r\n569\r\n01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:58.360\r\nFrancis: I'm putting a lot of my own stuff in here. And\r\n\r\n570\r\n01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.670\r\nFrancis: as I've been kind of like talking through this I've told them, like little bits about me\r\n\r\n571\r\n01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:07.680\r\nFrancis: and that's where it knows, what I say,\r\n\r\n572\r\n01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:20.100\r\nFrancis: oh, I talked about this. In there.\r\n\r\n573\r\n01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:30.359\r\nFrancis: Well, actually, I said, those vite I, mentioned the the right viral posts, like social media scheduling tools. This they came out with this on its own like that was pretty good stuff.\r\n\r\n574\r\n01:25:31.068 --> 01:25:34.900\r\nFrancis: But this is definitely much more in line\r\n\r\n575\r\n01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.499\r\nFrancis: in line with me although not quite there yet.\r\n\r\n576\r\n01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:58.360\r\nFrancis: Version 2 firm but fair level 5 and 6. Stop creating content. Wait, hear me out, let your conversations do instead. Last week bit analyzed my coaching calls, and discovered something that completely changed. How I think about content. Bit bit's my AI co-pilot.\r\n\r\n577\r\n01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:28.069\r\nFrancis: Atlas is the one who does the heavy lifting they're about to become your favorite team. Here's what we found. The average coach is 5 to 10 conversations per week that could become 200 plus pieces of content. Instead, those conversations disappear into the zoom cloud while you stress about what to post tomorrow. Sound familiar. I get it. I really do. For 10 years I've been the behind the scenes writer creating content systems for coaches, 10 million words written 10 million plus in revenue generated and hundreds of campaigns launched.\r\n\r\n578\r\n01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.289\r\nFrancis: and you know what killed me.\r\n\r\n579\r\n01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:39.170\r\nFrancis: watching brilliant coaches struggle with content while mediocre ones dominate the space, the difference systems. Here's the uncomfortable truth.\r\n\r\n580\r\n01:26:39.170 --> 01:27:02.400\r\nFrancis: your best content already exists. It's in your coaching, calls, your strategy sessions, your masterclasses, your workshops. Every single conversation contains complete story arcs that would make Andre chaperone, proud, quotable insights. Your audience desperately needs teaching frameworks. You don't even realize you're sharing email sequences, hiding your explanations. Social posts scattered throughout your sentences within 1 h of\r\n\r\n581\r\n01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:14.940\r\nFrancis: ending your zoom call. All this could be extracted, formatted, and ready to post. But AI content sucks. You're absolutely right, those generic right viral post tools. They're why, everyone sounds the same.\r\n\r\n582\r\n01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:34.889\r\nFrancis: It's exactly why I built something different. And here's how this actually works. Instead of templates, you get custom prompts built specifically for your voice. You start with a content DNA session, where I learn your unique frameworks, your communication style, your brand personality, your audience's languages. Then build custom, brand kits, design kits and prompts.\r\n\r\n583\r\n01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:59.210\r\nFrancis: Capture your essence, not generic. AI, slop your actual voice, automate, and here's the kicker every one to 2 weeks. We were fine together, and I know, like, I'm really not liking this very much. But I'm reading this all the way through for 2 reasons. One, it's super important to read your copy out loud, to hear how it sounds, but also to like there might be like one or 2 nuggets in here that I really like\r\n\r\n584\r\n01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:04.470\r\nFrancis: that I can use. Right? I\r\n\r\n585\r\n01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.246\r\nFrancis: I like this part.\r\n\r\n586\r\n01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:20.379\r\nFrancis: you know, this is, this is decent, like, we can do something with this. But like, for the most part, I'm just not. Yeah. I like the 10 better. Not generic. AI slop.\r\n\r\n587\r\n01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:29.320\r\nFrancis: Your actual voice automated. Here's the kicker everyone fine together because your voice evolves, your message sharpens your system. Should, too. This one. This is good\r\n\r\n588\r\n01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:33.899\r\nFrancis: math is simple. We did that. Why I built this.\r\n\r\n589\r\n01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:47.520\r\nFrancis: I spent years managing content teams for coaches. I hate it managing people, coordinating schedules, chasing deadlines. It was everything I didn't want to do. I just wanted to create great content. That converts. I built a system that came up.\r\n\r\n590\r\n01:28:50.686 --> 01:28:51.580\r\nFrancis: Excuse me.\r\n\r\n591\r\n01:28:51.960 --> 01:29:14.640\r\nFrancis: So I built a system that could handle 89% of the heavy lifting. Now, one person can manage what used to take a team and coaches can focus on coaching instead of content. Creation. Here's the thing. The coaches succeeding right now are better than you. They just show up more consistently while you're playing content. They're posting content while you're finding your voice. They're amplifying theirs while you're learning canva. They're closing clients.\r\n\r\n592\r\n01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:31.539\r\nFrancis: The gap isn't talent. It's systems. I can only take 10 new clients this month. This isn't fake scarcity. It's real bandwidth. Each client gets custom prompt, developed, personal onboarding, bi-weekly refinement sessions by decade of experience. Quality takes time or is refuse to compromise on that what happens next?\r\n\r\n593\r\n01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:43.179\r\nFrancis: You reach out with ready for systems. We schedule a content DNA system. I build your custom system during the call, no pressure sales zeros, right? So I'm just gonna skip the rest of that because\r\n\r\n594\r\n01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:49.940\r\nFrancis: kind of yeah, I just I like, I like the Sas version better for sure\r\n\r\n595\r\n01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:56.190\r\nFrancis: but still not quite there yet. So we're just going to\r\n\r\n596\r\n01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:06.570\r\nFrancis: go from here right? So like this part.\r\n\r\n597\r\n01:30:07.148 --> 01:30:11.810\r\nFrancis: I feel it's less funny than when I read it the 1st time.\r\n\r\n598\r\n01:30:12.399 --> 01:30:18.659\r\nFrancis: I think that's because it's trying to jam it together. So like the 1st thing I'm gonna do is\r\n\r\n599\r\n01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:24.760\r\nFrancis: copy this.\r\n\r\n600\r\n01:30:34.290 --> 01:30:48.449\r\nFrancis: I don't really like that section as much as I did in your rubric or grading. I feel like it kind of falls a little bit flat when you scrunch it all together. I think\r\n\r\n601\r\n01:30:48.780 --> 01:31:03.888\r\nFrancis: having something earlier on about cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running system. Well, I don't like the competitors. Running systems part. The cosplaying Va is really good. And then, later on,\r\n\r\n602\r\n01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:10.980\r\nFrancis: you had something about oh.\r\n\r\n603\r\n01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:26.838\r\nFrancis: the intern thing, and I forgot where it was. But, like I I like that, I think, combining those together early on could be a nice little comedic relief and\r\n\r\n604\r\n01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:47.710\r\nFrancis: humorous bit to get into the content right away and pull people in. So what if we drop the every manual post you create as a choice to say small and like. Try to use that somewhere later in the post and focus this once, like on the cause playing with like the Va intern stuff, because I think that could be a lot funnier.\r\n\r\n605\r\n01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:06.600\r\nFrancis: Oh, oh.\r\n\r\n606\r\n01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:16.300\r\nFrancis: shoot so I didn't have like the text box.\r\n\r\n607\r\n01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:23.879\r\nFrancis: Oh, it's control command. B.\r\n\r\n608\r\n01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.479\r\nFrancis: There we go\r\n\r\n609\r\n01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:38.303\r\nFrancis: alright. And then so this is all I'm gonna do. As I go through here is just say like what I like and don't, and how I want to finish it.\r\n\r\n610\r\n01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:49.080\r\nFrancis: I'm not gonna pause and actually go through this like and talk you guys so you can hear how I like go through this and think about this rather than just\r\n\r\n611\r\n01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:54.680\r\nFrancis: do, and then be like, Oh, here, here's the output. Because that's not helpful.\r\n\r\n612\r\n01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:23.750\r\nFrancis: I'm not really liking the integration of bit and atlas into this right it it seems a bit jarring and confusing of like, Who's this bit person analyzing the coaching calls? And who's this Atlas person structuring together? So I think maybe we should just drop that all together for this and just not use the characters at all.\r\n\r\n613\r\n01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.830\r\nFrancis: What else\r\n\r\n614\r\n01:33:42.370 --> 01:33:48.599\r\nFrancis: I do like the stern at Canva 11 pm. Reference. That's pretty solid.\r\n\r\n615\r\n01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:56.980\r\nFrancis: I also really like the think about it. Section the Monday, Tuesday, fri. Through Friday, like those those really good\r\n\r\n616\r\n01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.260\r\nFrancis: I think we should keep those and then\r\n\r\n617\r\n01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.770\r\nFrancis: oh, here we there's the larping\r\n\r\n618\r\n01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:09.640\r\nFrancis: as your own intern. I think that's really good to\r\n\r\n619\r\n01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.359\r\nFrancis: alright. I didn't mean to say that in there\r\n\r\n620\r\n01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:25.549\r\nFrancis: I just got excited when I found it all right. Should keep those\r\n\r\n621\r\n01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:50.432\r\nFrancis: The. Here's what's actually insane. Part is pretty solid, too. We can keep that again like dropping the bitten Atlas can extract all that\r\n\r\n622\r\n01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:14.420\r\nFrancis: I think it would be beneficial to just say something along the lines of\r\n\r\n623\r\n01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:18.679\r\nFrancis: as soon as your zoom call is done processing\r\n\r\n624\r\n01:35:19.436 --> 01:35:33.300\r\nFrancis: you know we leverage AI and automations to analyze the transcript for the best moments, using code.\r\n\r\n625\r\n01:35:33.670 --> 01:35:38.589\r\nFrancis: Something like that, you know. We turn that long form into clips right away\r\n\r\n626\r\n01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:53.180\r\nFrancis: and then iterate over each clip to create. I don't know. Post something like that. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for there, but I do like the idea of like the\r\n\r\n627\r\n01:35:53.910 --> 01:36:06.400\r\nFrancis: the AI, you know, bit. Does this Atlas does that? You go have lunch? But again dropping like bit and atlas, and just having some sort of like AI is doing this thing while you're off living your life\r\n\r\n628\r\n01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:19.860\r\nFrancis: and right. And that's 1 thing that I really kind of like want to touch on what I think is so exciting about AI, and everybody is like freaked out like AI is gonna take our jobs like, yes, good, please, please, like I don't.\r\n\r\n629\r\n01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:30.949\r\nFrancis: The more AI can do this. The more that I can like help. Other people like create better content for themselves right? Because, like writing good content.\r\n\r\n630\r\n01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:54.920\r\nFrancis: like, actually, right as a human like takes time, takes energy, lots of brain power and stuff like that. And it's also difficult, because, like, I don't actually know what my clients thinking, like, all I can go on is the conversations I've had and the things that they've shared with me, and I might have not asked the right questions like I do a pretty good job, and I try my best and things like that. But I don't always ask the right things. But\r\n\r\n631\r\n01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:01.219\r\nFrancis: if it's you writing the content for yourself, having a conversation with an AI,\r\n\r\n632\r\n01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:11.320\r\nFrancis: you know that that thing will spark or like. It'll ask a question like, Oh, that story right? Which might might not have been a story that you even thought about before. So\r\n\r\n633\r\n01:37:12.204 --> 01:37:18.690\r\nFrancis: there's a lot of benefits to being able to like. Do all this more yourself. And the AI is\r\n\r\n634\r\n01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:28.439\r\nFrancis: making that happen right like, especially in the copywriting. Field content creation field. It's taking those jobs. And it's going to keep taking\r\n\r\n635\r\n01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:36.719\r\nFrancis: people's jobs. And it's going to be starting with like those mundane move, data from one software to another.\r\n\r\n636\r\n01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:44.289\r\nFrancis: this, that and the other thing copy paste kind of stuff like a lot of Admin tasks. Things like that are going to be eaten up really quickly.\r\n\r\n637\r\n01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:57.429\r\nFrancis: and we're going to be freed up to do like cooler, better things, right like, instead of thinking like, Oh, my God, you know, executive assistant like you're gonna fire them because of AI. It's like, no like they're going to. Now have\r\n\r\n638\r\n01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:14.200\r\nFrancis: an AI tool that has all of your conversations that you've been having with clients, them team, whatever that they can infinitely query to help them come up with plans, ideas, executions for the stuff that you want to happen\r\n\r\n639\r\n01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:22.179\r\nFrancis: right? So it's going to give them more power to do their job faster and better like. That's what we're getting into. So\r\n\r\n640\r\n01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:23.990\r\nFrancis: back to it.\r\n\r\n641\r\n01:38:26.157 --> 01:38:31.173\r\nFrancis: Ai content is garbage right? Those red error.\r\n\r\n642\r\n01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:34.489\r\nFrancis: I really like the pull on.\r\n\r\n643\r\n01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:41.165\r\nFrancis: I really like the viral post tool section that's really good. I think.\r\n\r\n644\r\n01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:52.019\r\nFrancis: kind of putting ourselves against those works really well, because there are like dozens of right viral content software out there.\r\n\r\n645\r\n01:38:52.619 --> 01:39:03.920\r\nFrancis: But the they pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration poem that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune. Cookie is absolutely fire.\r\n\r\n646\r\n01:39:04.468 --> 01:39:08.950\r\nFrancis: I love that I like and want to have more\r\n\r\n647\r\n01:39:09.170 --> 01:39:13.129\r\nFrancis: lines like that throughout the content.\r\n\r\n648\r\n01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.130\r\nFrancis: Let's see.\r\n\r\n649\r\n01:39:31.330 --> 01:39:34.929\r\nFrancis: Alright. So let's see this next part here. Oh.\r\n\r\n650\r\n01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:51.940\r\nFrancis: so I like this start of the here's what separates this from every other. AI content scam section.\r\n\r\n651\r\n01:39:52.366 --> 01:40:00.940\r\nFrancis: But what I do want to kind of get into a little bit more of like what it is, what they're getting kind of thing, because it's not\r\n\r\n652\r\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.110\r\nFrancis: quite accurate right now.\r\n\r\n653\r\n01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:13.180\r\nFrancis: What?\r\n\r\n654\r\n01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.090\r\nFrancis: Oh, what?\r\n\r\n655\r\n01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:26.300\r\nFrancis: So what this is more about is like, we're gonna have the content DNA\r\n\r\n656\r\n01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:52.750\r\nFrancis: call. And that's designed to get the custom brand Kit design Kit. And then Meta prompt so they can create their own content. But that's more of like a free lead magnet kind of thing, like a way to give value 1st and like show proof, this works. We're not building their system or anything on the call. They're not getting anything like done on the caller like that point of this is to\r\n\r\n657\r\n01:40:53.150 --> 01:41:10.980\r\nFrancis: get them the prompts that they can use and start putting it like chat to your cloud right now and create content, but also to like. I am going to give them some clips and some example posts created by the system, just to show them like what's possible.\r\n\r\n658\r\n01:41:11.784 --> 01:41:22.780\r\nFrancis: Using this system. And you know, I do like the the one part of like you get to decide if this is something you want permanently, right? So like, basically, what\r\n\r\n659\r\n01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:51.139\r\nFrancis: we're gonna be doing is going over their business, who they are, what they're doing, what their offer is stuff like that to build out the brand and design Kit, I'm going to turn that call into a few clips for them for examples, and then go over that with them, and then, at the very least. They're going to have the brand Kit design Kit and the Meta prompt that they can use with just like a regular chat Gpt or Claude session and make whatever kind of content that they want manually that way. And it's just something. If they want\r\n\r\n660\r\n01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:55.470\r\nFrancis: help with the automation part of it, then we can talk about using my system.\r\n\r\n661\r\n01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:11.921\r\nFrancis: Let's see anything else.\r\n\r\n662\r\n01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:24.761\r\nFrancis: I really do like the section under the coaches who get ahead. Get this already ahead, like while you're finding your voice while you're playing content while you're building consistency. I like those.\r\n\r\n663\r\n01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:27.173\r\nFrancis: those are really solid.\r\n\r\n664\r\n01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:43.550\r\nFrancis: I do want you to drop the thing like truth. Bomb fair warning. That's a little bit like, too, on the nose for me. I'm much bigger fan of the\r\n\r\n665\r\n01:42:45.190 --> 01:42:49.823\r\nFrancis: 2 plus 2, and let them figure out it's 4 method, right?\r\n\r\n666\r\n01:42:50.430 --> 01:43:03.999\r\nFrancis: that's where it goes in the show and not tell like no one likes being told. But we do want to tell them and give them kind of the right ingredients for them to come to the conclusion that we want type of thing.\r\n\r\n667\r\n01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:11.019\r\nFrancis: Oh, my God! Need to remember to\r\n\r\n668\r\n01:43:14.450 --> 01:43:16.859\r\nFrancis: keep that on there. Okay, what else?\r\n\r\n669\r\n01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.410\r\nFrancis: Oh.\r\n\r\n670\r\n01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:31.629\r\nFrancis: I don't want to mention anything about like come back to 6 weeks of content like, I don't want to put the week thing in there, simply because, like\r\n\r\n671\r\n01:43:31.890 --> 01:43:41.970\r\nFrancis: a who are we to decide like how much content someone posts. And then the other thing, too, is like depending on how we set up these prompts. It might\r\n\r\n672\r\n01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:59.770\r\nFrancis: only be a day or 2 days, or a couple days worth of content. It just might be that we have custom stuff for each platform, like really kind of depends on the client and how much content they want to put out. Like, for example, I plan to do\r\n\r\n673\r\n01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:29.480\r\nFrancis: long form videos, multiple times a week and create a bunch of clips and content from that. And you know, ideally, you know, post a ton of clips from each of those where, like one of those videos might be like 2 or 3 days worth of content, only type of thing. So I don't want to say 6 weeks worth of content, because then that also seems like overwhelming. It's like, oh, well, then, what do I? What do I need this for? Like I'm just gonna like, fill up with so much content, so quickly like,\r\n\r\n674\r\n01:44:30.274 --> 01:44:43.170\r\nFrancis: so again, this is more for giving them like a bunch of content. That they can put out everywhere and just make sure that they're getting exposure, because, like the one thing that we can know for certain is that\r\n\r\n675\r\n01:44:43.630 --> 01:45:05.660\r\nFrancis: if you put out more content, more people are going to see your content right if if every video you get gets 200 views and you put out one video a day, that's 200 views. But if you put out 5 videos a day that now becomes a thousand views right? And you can easily just start to multiply the views you get\r\n\r\n676\r\n01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:15.229\r\nFrancis: by putting out more content. Even if you're not necessarily growing right away, because there is like a certain amount of consistency and timing that you need to like.\r\n\r\n677\r\n01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.030\r\nFrancis: put on these platforms to build up an audience\r\n\r\n678\r\n01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:25.938\r\nFrancis: didn't mean to send in that last part. That was kind of just the conversation to that's supposed to be for us, but we'll see what\r\n\r\n679\r\n01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:27.930\r\nFrancis: we'll see what it does with that.\r\n\r\n680\r\n01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:35.702\r\nFrancis: Here's exactly what happens. You reach out here 2 choices.\r\n\r\n681\r\n01:45:41.290 --> 01:45:46.899\r\nFrancis: I'm not too happy with the ending with, like the 2 choices.\r\n\r\n682\r\n01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:54.819\r\nFrancis: Type of thing. It it falls a little flat. 1st off like I'm not. Gonna send them a\r\n\r\n683\r\n01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.459\r\nFrancis: example of another call like that seems pointless like when we're gonna do like\r\n\r\n684\r\n01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:09.979\r\nFrancis: a call together. And they're gonna have like specific content for them. Right? Like, why would I want to see a generic example of someone else. When I can get\r\n\r\n685\r\n01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.859\r\nFrancis: one. That's for me. Right? So\r\n\r\n686\r\n01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:39.389\r\nFrancis: let's drop that part. Also, it's 2025, not 2024. I like the the hand washing clothes, analogy type thing. And then how you also do like folds, organizes, delivers. Could we find a different but similar analogy that might be like a little bit more ridiculous and funny. So we end it kind of on like a fun. Humorous note.\r\n\r\n687\r\n01:46:39.788 --> 01:46:45.039\r\nFrancis: You know just anything that just kind of makes a little bit more like ridiculous and extreme\r\n\r\n688\r\n01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:49.219\r\nFrancis: pretzels. Oh.\r\n\r\n689\r\n01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.970\r\nFrancis: alright! We'll see what we get there.\r\n\r\n690\r\n01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:56.770\r\nFrancis: And then last thing.\r\n\r\n691\r\n01:46:57.430 --> 01:47:24.259\r\nFrancis: and to be clear, these were all suggestions and edits for the level. 10 Sas. Post. I like that a lot better than the level 5 to 6 1. i thought the 5 to 6 1 was actually just like pretty flat and overall. Just not very inspiring up in that. Sas is definitely better. I was actually impressed or not impressed. I was surprised that it wasn't\r\n\r\n692\r\n01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:30.970\r\nFrancis: more sas, I guess, but worked out pretty well. I think we could like up\r\n\r\n693\r\n01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:39.070\r\nFrancis: up the Sas just a hair with a few more of those funny one-liners like I mentioned, but overall very good with that.\r\n\r\n694\r\n01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:58.462\r\nFrancis: and I would say, just like, Let's drop the\r\n\r\n695\r\n01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:08.062\r\nFrancis: second one and just kind of fell flat like I said, I don't think we need to really like. Do anything more with it.\r\n\r\n696\r\n01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.330\r\nFrancis: we'll just drop it for now and work on the 1st post.\r\n\r\n697\r\n01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:26.630\r\nFrancis: All right. Didn't mean to hit. Enter. Yeah, I want to put one more thing. Let's stop that minutes.\r\n\r\n698\r\n01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:30.160\r\nFrancis: It's\r\n\r\n699\r\n01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:42.430\r\nFrancis: so before I start speaking with the intro here. I do always like giving some kind of like\r\n\r\n700\r\n01:48:43.360 --> 01:49:05.800\r\nFrancis: starting with either encouragement, reinforcement, or kind of critiques right away, just to like. Let the AI know like where I stand on the content. You know I might say like this is not anything that I was looking for. I don't like any of this blah blah, or I might say like, Oh, my God, this is great, this fantastic start! Here's some edits I want to make stuff like that.\r\n\r\n701\r\n01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:13.300\r\nFrancis: I think that just does a good job like helping to prime the AI and knowing like is this, you know, like.\r\n\r\n702\r\n01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.499\r\nFrancis: is this going in a\r\n\r\n703\r\n01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:27.420\r\nFrancis: minor edits way, or like we go and rewrite right like there, there is something, and we'll get into that more. But there is like something about like activating different parts of their memory.\r\n\r\n704\r\n01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:40.737\r\nFrancis: This is a really good start. I like a lot of the edits and updates that we made. So far, I think we have just a little bit more to go. And I've put\r\n\r\n705\r\n01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:51.340\r\nFrancis: my suggestions, notes, ideas below here. I need you to analyze those and then rewrite and update the 1st version.\r\n\r\n706\r\n01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:57.800\r\nFrancis: Make it more in line with what I'm talking about, and just generally better.\r\n\r\n707\r\n01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:06.650\r\nFrancis: I really need to like find a better way to say like, Make it better, because, like.\r\n\r\n708\r\n01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:11.219\r\nFrancis: what does better mean? Right? So maybe actually, what we'll do.\r\n\r\n709\r\n01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:23.900\r\nFrancis: let's see, make it more aligned with my talk about, and at least 10% better.\r\n\r\n710\r\n01:50:24.330 --> 01:50:25.890\r\nFrancis: Then the current\r\n\r\n711\r\n01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:39.329\r\nFrancis: version and try that. And then we always want to go back down to the end and just do kind of a quick context, synopsis summary, and like one more time, like what we want to\r\n\r\n712\r\n01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.299\r\nFrancis: after analyzing your\r\n\r\n713\r\n01:50:44.520 --> 01:51:05.500\r\nFrancis: post above and all the additional contacts I've given you, I need you to rewrite the Facebook post. So it's more in line with what I said above. I want it to be a little bit funnier, too, and then also just ensure that it's 10% better and more\r\n\r\n714\r\n01:51:06.170 --> 01:51:09.200\r\nFrancis: interesting engaging for our coaching audience.\r\n\r\n715\r\n01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.209\r\nFrancis: Alright, let's see what happens there. And as it's\r\n\r\n716\r\n01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.711\r\nFrancis: chat as it's thinking and doing its thing.\r\n\r\n717\r\n01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:27.309\r\nFrancis: you know, I gotta wrap this up here because I've got another call. I have to\r\n\r\n718\r\n01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:31.960\r\nFrancis: run off to. But I think this is a great start with kind of showing like\r\n\r\n719\r\n01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:34.729\r\nFrancis: what you can do.\r\n\r\n720\r\n01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:46.220\r\nFrancis: both with just like the difference of how. And I think the main thing that like I want to show is like the difference between just like throwing in a prompt here and seeing what you get\r\n\r\n721\r\n01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.850\r\nFrancis: versus having one of these projects with\r\n\r\n722\r\n01:51:51.130 --> 01:52:04.810\r\nFrancis: a prompt already built into it. And mind you like, what we'll be doing in the next video is actually going over the brand kit and probably this specific prompt and refine it more right? Because it's like.\r\n\r\n723\r\n01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:15.100\r\nFrancis: well, let's see what. Let's see what happens. Let's see what we got with this rewritten version. Maximum. Wake up energy. Let me get hydrated first.st\r\n\r\n724\r\n01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:30.990\r\nFrancis: Stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do instead, because right now your cosplay is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that make content in their sleep.\r\n\r\n725\r\n01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:46.299\r\nFrancis: Yes, Karen, from your mastermind, the one who suddenly posts everywhere. She's not working hard. She just stopped playing intern. Last Tuesday I analyzed my coaching call recordings and discovered something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the robots handle it. Now.\r\n\r\n726\r\n01:52:46.480 --> 01:53:00.299\r\nFrancis: here's what I found. You're performing the same brilliant conversation 5 times a week, creating exactly 0 content from it. Then staring at canva at 11 pm. Trying to remember if you used Montserrat or railway last time.\r\n\r\n727\r\n01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:24.130\r\nFrancis: This is insane behavior. Think about Monday strategy session, where you drop pure gold. Tuesday group coaching masterclass everyone loved vanished. Wednesday. Sales. Call where you explain your entire methodology. Gone. Thursday workshop, where 3 people cried from breakthroughs, poof! Friday. Interview where you finally nailed your origin. Story, dust, 300 min of certified genius, 0 content created\r\n\r\n728\r\n01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:34.079\r\nFrancis: but sure spend money. Saturday bashing, content, translation, panic, Korean mediocre post where your coffee gets cold and your family wonders if you still live there.\r\n\r\n729\r\n01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:48.620\r\nFrancis: Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice every single zoom call contains 12 to 15. Complete story arcs. The kind Andre chaperone charges 10 KA month to map out.\r\n\r\n730\r\n01:53:49.080 --> 01:54:04.170\r\nFrancis: I forgot to take this out like no one cares like if anybody even knows who's Andre Chaperon is like, I'd be surprised like he's very much more of a lifestyle business guy. But he's absolutely one of my favorite marking writers. So like.\r\n\r\n731\r\n01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:14.390\r\nFrancis: yeah, I forgot to mention that you know what we're just gonna go back and do that really quick. See, this is where I talk about like I will go back and redo this\r\n\r\n732\r\n01:54:14.730 --> 01:54:21.619\r\nFrancis: when I don't like something, or if I forgot something, and it really here, we'll put it here, because that's right around the same spot.\r\n\r\n733\r\n01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:38.879\r\nFrancis: Don't mention Andre chaperone, or really like any of the creators in my brand kit. Those aren't something to be explicitly referenced or said publicly. I gave those in the brand kit so that you have a better understanding of\r\n\r\n734\r\n01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:50.000\r\nFrancis: who I like to create content like or other creators that, like I enjoy their content, think they're good writers, things like that, and would be excited if someone\r\n\r\n735\r\n01:54:50.210 --> 01:55:08.129\r\nFrancis: thought my content was similar to theirs. So it's more so a design style thing, than anything that you should ever, ever, ever mention their name like I never want to see like their names come up unless it's something that like I've explicitly referenced that you're transforming, but never introduce their name on your own.\r\n\r\n736\r\n01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:08.930\r\nFrancis: Okay.\r\n\r\n737\r\n01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:36.849\r\nFrancis: alright. So we'll drop that back in there and give it a second to rewrite and again, like, that's, I think, a really important thing, too, is like, if you see some of those little errors as you go go back and redo this. It's gonna save you a lot as far as like context and conversations goes, because, like Claude has a limit.\r\n\r\n738\r\n01:55:36.850 --> 01:55:54.480\r\nFrancis: Chatgp doesn't really anymore. Now that it has the memory feature built in like. I haven't reached a conversation limit, but there are very real conversational limits with Claude now. So if you kind of go back and tweak this a bit. It also gives you a better starting spot right like\r\n\r\n739\r\n01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:56.696\r\nFrancis: from here.\r\n\r\n740\r\n01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:11.589\r\nFrancis: I would probably go back and keep redoing this and keep editing this until I get closer to what I wanted to the point of even like, maybe I would take this section out, or I'd re explain that section. So\r\n\r\n741\r\n01:56:11.993 --> 01:56:24.330\r\nFrancis: let's see what it said. Now stop creating content seriously. Stop, let your conversations do instead, because right now your cosplan is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that work while you sleep.\r\n\r\n742\r\n01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:49.420\r\nFrancis: Yes, you, the one who just opened canva in another tab. Close it. Here's what I discovered last Tuesday. So, you know, I'm still not super happy with this opening, and I don't think we're going to quite get there in this session, and that's what we're going to. I guess this is what I'll kind of leave you off with, and a little tease here is like the next thing that we're going to do\r\n\r\n743\r\n01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:57.170\r\nFrancis: in the next video is, I'm going to redo my brand kit. And I think we'll actually work on a\r\n\r\n744\r\n01:56:57.290 --> 01:57:00.149\r\nFrancis: structured prompts right? Like I have\r\n\r\n745\r\n01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:08.180\r\nFrancis: have this social post, right? We should probably have. Actually, you know, I'm gonna do this really quick.\r\n\r\n746\r\n01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:20.579\r\nFrancis: No, I'm not because I don't necessarily like this like this is just kind of like a placeholder to to get stuff going. So what will come back in this next video is\r\n\r\n747\r\n01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:46.190\r\nFrancis: restructuring this prompt and then kind of going back through the same similar exercise and showing like how to do it like. Quote unquote the right way, right like I. I would put this like the good wrong way, like, if you don't have your own Meta prompts create or structured prompts created where you can kind of consistently put.\r\n\r\n748\r\n01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:59.749\r\nFrancis: create content, a certain output. This would be the way that you really should be having a conversation with the ais like you start with something right. You have to give it some sort of\r\n\r\n749\r\n01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:07.489\r\nFrancis: draft piece finished piece, whatever it might be, the better that you can give it in the beginning.\r\n\r\n750\r\n01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:26.030\r\nFrancis: the better. The conversation is gonna go. But, like, you know, if you don't have a lot of marketing or copyright experience like that's fine, right, give it something and then work with it from there to improve it. And you know you can start with just saying like, Hey, first, st I need to create a rubric\r\n\r\n751\r\n01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:28.940\r\nFrancis: to make this better oops.\r\n\r\n752\r\n01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:38.009\r\nFrancis: and then from there it'll give you a bunch of ideas and things like that. If you need more suggestions, ask for more suggestions. You just go back and have this back and forth conversation\r\n\r\n753\r\n01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:42.550\r\nFrancis: until you get the way you want. And is there a pain?\r\n\r\n754\r\n01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:48.839\r\nFrancis: Kind of yeah. But what I'll show you in the next video is like how you can either a\r\n\r\n755\r\n01:58:49.190 --> 01:58:52.659\r\nFrancis: take that like a, you know, like we originally did\r\n\r\n756\r\n01:58:53.330 --> 01:58:56.540\r\nFrancis: in this one right? And it creates a prompt for it\r\n\r\n757\r\n01:58:57.270 --> 01:59:03.840\r\nFrancis: for this rubric, and you can go back in and then refine the prompt to be like exactly what you're looking for\r\n\r\n758\r\n01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:12.669\r\nFrancis: and then work with it from there, and kind of restart the conversation type of thing right? Because, like, if I went, I took this prompt\r\n\r\n759\r\n01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:18.850\r\nFrancis: actually, let's see what happens when I do take this prompt\r\n\r\n760\r\n01:59:36.690 --> 01:59:40.379\r\nFrancis: alright. Let's just see while I kind of blab on a little bit.\r\n\r\n761\r\n01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:50.290\r\nFrancis: So now this is actually taking that rubric that we gave, and it's going to edit it based on that\r\n\r\n762\r\n01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:59.830\r\nFrancis: right. And I'll probably come up with something like even better than what we had before, and\r\n\r\n763\r\n02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:08.080\r\nFrancis: you just kind of keep working out from there. And then, once you have that prompt d plus it got it went up a little bit interesting.\r\n\r\n764\r\n02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.190\r\nFrancis: But\r\n\r\n765\r\n02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:36.840\r\nFrancis: once you have that kind of base prompt, you can start to work with it and use it, and that's what we'll be doing in the next video is, I will actually be kind of going through of like creating a very structured prompt with, Hey, how to create a good lead, how to create a good hook, what goes in the body, and like more and more and more details about that. So I'm not having this kind of like back and forth where?\r\n\r\n766\r\n02:00:37.597 --> 02:01:04.969\r\nFrancis: You know, to be perfectly honest like that last those last couple of versions that it's not done. Those last couple versions that we saw. I'm like these are better. But again, like the hook lead is still just not quite there. So that's something that we can work on and fix with a really good, detailed, prompt. And that's what I'm going to be covering the next video here and now, just to end this out like, let's just take a look at what the difference is with\r\n\r\n767\r\n02:01:05.090 --> 02:01:13.779\r\nFrancis: putting in that much more explicit, prompt about with, like the actual rubric in there, generic opening\r\n\r\n768\r\n02:01:13.890 --> 02:01:21.900\r\nFrancis: 0 pattern interrupt right? Like. So it's saying a lot of similar things, you know, obviously, that we would think but\r\n\r\n769\r\n02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:24.160\r\nFrancis: is getting more\r\n\r\n770\r\n02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:33.520\r\nFrancis: insight into why, it's yes or no right complete voice mismatch. This reads like every Guru sales page, not pragmatic text, heavy blah, blah\r\n\r\n771\r\n02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:37.950\r\nFrancis: 0 brand characters where it's Atlas, where it's bit right? So like\r\n\r\n772\r\n02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:40.843\r\nFrancis: it's pretty similar to like what we've\r\n\r\n773\r\n02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:53.579\r\nFrancis: gone through already. But it gives more context, which would be super super helpful if you are someone who's newer to marketing, and you're just not entirely sure like why, this would be like good or bad.\r\n\r\n774\r\n02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:00.269\r\nFrancis: That opening is deader than Disco.\r\n\r\n775\r\n02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:04.360\r\nFrancis: The fake empathy is nauseating.\r\n\r\n776\r\n02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:14.385\r\nFrancis: You buried your actual differentiator. Your brand has 10 years experience, see? See? So like, that's that's a really interesting point that like hasn't been brought up yet.\r\n\r\n777\r\n02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:28.279\r\nFrancis: that it's saying that the actual differentiator is that experience. And like, where is any of that you know credibility. We get the trust me, Bro. Energy, right? So like this would be like, Hey, like, let's just make sure that we get that like higher up.\r\n\r\n778\r\n02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:35.919\r\nFrancis: You know, if you follow Alex from Osel with the proof promise plan, you know, starting out with a proof like 10 years experience\r\n\r\n779\r\n02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.227\r\nFrancis: 10 million dollars. 10 million words that kind of thing.\r\n\r\n780\r\n02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:55.079\r\nFrancis: let's see what it says for new. See? Like, look, look we didn't get this hook before, after writing 10 million words and building 500 plus automation flows. I've discovered the 7 min prompt chain that turns any zoom call into 30 pieces of content.\r\n\r\n781\r\n02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:13.760\r\nFrancis: So like it's not quite what I would use, just simply because, like, it's not totally accurate. But this much better hook than the last one. Right. I like it more than the stop creating content, and whatever else character driven story\r\n\r\n782\r\n02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:21.329\r\nFrancis: Atlas here last Tuesday had been analyzed. No right like we. Just my character's wrong. So we're just gonna have to drop the character stuff.\r\n\r\n783\r\n02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:29.649\r\nFrancis: Contrarian challenge. Your content. Strategy is backwards. Stop creating. Start capturing. Here's the na and M. Workflow that changed everything.\r\n\r\n784\r\n02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:38.189\r\nFrancis: Right? So if I want to go more of a technical route, maybe if I was going after like automation\r\n\r\n785\r\n02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:50.887\r\nFrancis: people and saying like, Hey, like I have a like a done for you, product that like you can sell and use and modify yourself like I might go that angle with that\r\n\r\n786\r\n02:03:52.150 --> 02:03:56.670\r\nFrancis: you know. But again the the, the prompt itself.\r\n\r\n787\r\n02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:13.609\r\nFrancis: kind of lacks a bit of understand like who my actual audience is, and simply because I just haven't updated updated with like, who I'm going after. Now, I've been kind of in a audience finding as I built this out.\r\n\r\n788\r\n02:04:15.190 --> 02:04:21.629\r\nFrancis: driving gold, sharing insights. I like that. I like that right? So like overall like I'm I'm enjoying these\r\n\r\n789\r\n02:04:22.835 --> 02:04:28.880\r\nFrancis: suggestions much better. And a cta that doesn't suck instead of drop a\r\n\r\n790\r\n02:04:29.050 --> 02:04:42.760\r\nFrancis: try. Curious how bit analyzes your calls. Watch them, dissect a real coaching session, extract 31 content pieces in 7 min. Link and comments. No email required like, I like this call to action a lot better again, if we just drop the\r\n\r\n791\r\n02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:52.820\r\nFrancis: character part of it. You know the linking comments. No email required. Basically, it's just saying, like, Hey, like, you want to see a demo of the system like you'll be able to watch.\r\n\r\n792\r\n02:04:53.370 --> 02:05:00.080\r\nFrancis: Send a comment. Just watch it. You don't have to do it. So right, this kind of inspires me of like, okay, like, maybe that's something I'll need to do\r\n\r\n793\r\n02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:08.769\r\nFrancis: as part of some of these posts is like, have that kind of follow on piece, and whether it's\r\n\r\n794\r\n02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:17.750\r\nFrancis: I don't know. Maybe it's just post, you know, like posting the full video like this to Youtube in the comments. So like, Hey, if you want to go deeper, check it out.\r\n\r\n795\r\n02:05:21.630 --> 02:05:26.000\r\nFrancis: So yeah, I'm gonna cut this here. I'm pretty sure we've gone on\r\n\r\n796\r\n02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:31.910\r\nFrancis: for longer than I thought. But I'm pretty pretty happy with how this\r\n\r\n797\r\n02:05:32.665 --> 02:05:42.670\r\nFrancis: how what we've gone through so far. And then I think the next thing that we'll do tomorrow is actually start to\r\n\r\n798\r\n02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:53.570\r\nFrancis: Start with the brand kit and the design Kit, I think it's really important to go into those. There's a few things I've learned since then that I'd like to\r\n\r\n799\r\n02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:57.548\r\nFrancis: Update and create like, I said, like I created these\r\n\r\n800\r\n02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:02.100\r\nFrancis: as like the minimum viable, prompt\r\n\r\n801\r\n02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:10.570\r\nFrancis: that I can have for all this stuff to like. Just get something that's generally correct like I said, like, I don't necessarily like\r\n\r\n802\r\n02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:29.319\r\nFrancis: a lot of this, but it was more for proof of concept, for the system to get something out there. And now what I'm going to be doing over the next few days is refining all this stuff and really putting some more thought and effort into it and getting\r\n\r\n803\r\n02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:39.990\r\nFrancis: getting this really down to the point where it's actually creating like content that I really really like. Because I know AI can do it. I've done it. I produced it.\r\n\r\n804\r\n02:06:40.280 --> 02:07:01.160\r\nFrancis: you know. A lot of it's just like in here, with some more back and forth, but with what I've really been learning the last couple months. I know that we can do this in the single shot with it here. So stay tuned for the next video where we're going to actually be diving into how to update and change some of these prompts\r\n\r\n805\r\n02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:04.199\r\nFrancis: so that they create better content\r\n\r\n806\r\n02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.889\r\nFrancis: and help AI create content that doesn't suck.\r\n\r\n807\r\n02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:15.379\r\nFrancis: Thanks for watching if you made it. This far, really enjoyed talking about this stuff and can't wait to talk more about it.\r\n\r\n"

That doesn't suck? That is the question of the day. My name is Francis Waldeker. I've generated over 10 million dollars in revenue for online coaches over the last 10 years, written over 10 million words of content for clients in that time frame to done a bunch of other stuff. But a lot of what I've been doing lately. The last 4 years is really diving deep into AI last 2 years. Everything that I've been paid for to write for clients has been produced by AI, and I've never gotten more compliments. So I would say, yes, yes, AI can write content. That doesn't suck. but it can't read your mind. And I think that's really the core of what a lot of people misunderstand about AI. They think because it's so intelligent and knows all these things right, like AI is at Phd level intelligence right now, like researchers, medical doctors like they're using this to discover like new things about science. It's not coming up with new stuff yet, but I mean, it's super super smart. So it can write content. It absolutely can. But just because it's really smart doesn't mean it can read your mind. We're gonna scroll up here. Here's a little bit of structure. We're gonna try to see what we get through today with these. But this, I think, will turn into a multi-part series here. And what I'm going to actually be doing is going through, really, how I create prompts, how I think about prompting context engineering things like that. I really like to prefer just client conversation structure. Right. I know that the tech people are going to be all mad at me and stuff like that, and prompted sharing. But we're just talking AI here right. AI is built very, very much like humans. And how we think it's just, it's trained on the Internet, right? So there is a lot of how we think. and how humans think already baked into AI, and those things that you think are like weird about AI like hallucinations. One of my favorite things, everybody's like, Oh, AI hallucinates. So do people right? Like a hallucination is just something that's made up. And what is creativity at its core is making stuff up right. And then also, too, like humans will make stuff up all the time if they like. Don't know the answer, and don't want to seem stupid, so they'll constantly say whatever they can think of. That might sound smart, right whatever. So AI works a lot like humans. And and when you think of it like that. It makes it a lot easier to work with instead of treating it like this all-knowing thing that you can just be like, Hey, create a you know Facebook post for me. Right? We'll get into this a little bit more in a minute. Here we go. right. So this is Claude. This is a new 4.1 opus model that just dropped. You can use any model. It really doesn't matter. At this point I'll get more of that. But it's largely preference. But I go write me a viral Facebook post for online coaches that would get them to want to use my content automation system that automatically takes Zoom calls, turn them into clips and turns those clips in different pieces of written and image asset content. Put me together a long form Facebook post that will attract new clients and have them reaching out to me. Word to the wise. Make sure you hit record. Before starting this I record about an hour and a half of me going through all of this and totally forgot to hit record. So we're coming back through and basically going to walk through what I did with a lot of this stuff and kind of pick up where we left off here. So hopefully, we'll shorten things down. Probably not shorten things. But you're gonna get a lot more out of it than I did the 1st time around. So that's a prompt right? That's a the beginning of a conversation with AI. And this is a great example of expecting AI to read my mind right? I want long form Facebook posts that will attract new clients and have them reach out to me. I mean, that sounds fairly specific, right? Like. you might be able to say this to a very experienced marketer copywriter, and they could go and turn out some good content for you from here, but more than likely not because they don't, you know, if they don't know a lot about you, that's that's really it like, why AI writes bad content. it's because a lack of understanding about you, right? You know you're not probably Hubspot or Alex her Mosey, or you know some giant creator out there where there's tons and tons and tons of knowledge about you that the AI can just go and grab. You have to give it all that, because here. when you don't this is the kind of stuff you get. I just watched a coach spend 4 h turning one zoom call into social media content, and I wanted to scream. Here's what they did, rewatched the entire 6 min recording manually wrote down Timestamps for the good parts edited. 3 clips took forever, wrote captions from scratch created, quote cards in canva, posted everything manually manually. Total time, 4 plus hours for maybe 5 pieces of content. Meanwhile I'm over here turning my zoom calls into 30 plus pieces of content in under 10 min, not because I'm some content genius, but because I finally built a system I wish existed when I was grinding 16 h days. Here's the truth most Gurus won't tell you. Your best content is already happening every single day. It's in your coaching calls. It's in your group sessions. It's in your masterminds. You're literally dropping gold in your Zoom Rooms, then letting it disappear into the cloud, while you're stressing about what? To post tomorrow? Quick question. What if every time you hit end meeting on zoom, you automatically got 10 to 15 video clips, edit caption rate of post quote cards with the best one, liars, full transcripts turned into blog posts, email sequences from your teaching points, Linkedin articles from your frameworks, Instagram carousels from your key concept. tweet threads from your golden nuggets without lifting a finger without hiring a Va without learning complicated software. This is in theory. Last week, 1 45 min strategy session I did became 12 Instagram reels, 8 Linkedin posts, 3 blog articles, 15. Quote cards, one email sequence content, scheduled for 3 weeks from one call, the same call. I was doing anyways. Look, I get it. You became a coach to coach, not to become a content factory. But here's what we both know. No content equals, no visibility, no visibility equals no clients, no clients, equals no impact. And you didn't build this business to be the world's best kept secret. The coaches crushing it right now. They're not smarter than you. They're not better coaches than you. They just show up everywhere because they have systems that multiply their message while they sleep. Here's what I believe your expertise deserves to be heard. Your message needs to reach people waiting for it. Your impact shouldn't be limited by how many hours you can spend on camera Canada. So I built something that handles all of it. Upload your Zoom recording. Walk away, come back to a month's worth of content, fair warning. This might feel like cheating when you post 5 times more without working harder when your engagement explodes, because you're finally consistent when leads start sliding to your dms, asking how you're everywhere. You might feel a little guilty. You'll get over it when you see your bank account. I'm only bringing on 10 coaches this month, not because of fake scarcity, but because I personally onboard everyone to make sure they're getting results within 48 h. If you're done with staring at blank screens, posting sporadically and hoping for the best watching competitors dominate your feed, knowing you have value, but struggling to package it, and you're ready for content creation on autopilot, showing up consistently without burning out, without burnout train, every conversation to marking gold. actually having time to coach instead of create. Then we should talk. Drop a rocket below or DM, Me. Automate. Right now I'll send you 3 min video showing the entire system in action. No sales calls required, no pushy tactics. Just watch the video and decide if you want your content to be that this easy, because your next zoom call could be 30 pieces of content, or it could be another lost opportunity. Your choice, Ps. Every day you wait is literally content. Gold sitting in your zoom cloud that could be bringing you clients just saying, Pps, that coach who spent 4 h on content. They're now my client. Last week they posted 47 pieces of content and booked. 6 discovery calls from 2 zoom recordings. This could be you. This post uses psychology triggers like Fomo, social proof transformation stories and clear benefits while maintaining authenticity and addressing the real pain, points online coaches face without content or with content. Creation? No? Well, I was pretty confident that was Those are good posts there, right? And that's how AI works. Right? It wants to be a helpful assistant. There's a if you read the Claude system promise in like 5,000 words or lines, but in there it talks a lot about like how its ultimate goal is to be helpful. If you ever heard of the the clawed, vending machine experiment where it did. Terrible. That's this, because the system prompt is designed to be helpful. So like it thinks it's being helpful here, and it's always going to try to fulfill your request as best it can with what's what it's given right? Because, like. that's the weird thing about AI as smart as these models are. At the end of the day. They're still prediction algorithms and prediction machines, which essentially is what humans are too like that. Our brains are prediction machines like everything that we see and the words on the screen. All this is just light that comes into our eyes and our brain interprets and predicts like what it should be. Right like. We have that blind spot in our eyes so like something in here is, I'm not actually seeing. So we predict stuff, too, you know, no same way, like when you interrupt someone and finish their sentence thinking, like, you know, what they're about to say, like, you're doing the same thing. So let's stop harping on AI about how it does this poorly and figure out how to fix it right, because, like this isn't the worst post ever right, you know, you might think it's written by AI. I don't know. I feel like people kind of like jump the gun and go overboard on that these days. Everything's AI written. but it's not great right? This kind of feels like something a template toddler would have written. You know, those are those copywriters who've just masked template after template over the years and just fill in the blank. It's like, oh, here, put 5 bullets about this and do 5 bullets about that. So all this stuff comes out a little bit too formulaic, and I get it. There's a time and a place for that, especially early on. But the cool thing about AI, and like what's really awesome about AI is you can move beyond templates for your content, and, like kind of go up a chain with prompt templates, which we'll get into that. But I mean, those are essentially Meta and structured prompts that we'll go into, and these allow you to change and input different variables and get way better, more personalized, bespoke content. But still, in whatever framework and structure you like to create content. Right? Like all of them, work to a degree whether you do problem, agitate solution. Very heavy story focused more in your face. So like it doesn't. It doesn't matter what kind of content you want to create like pick something that resonates with you because of the authenticity part is going to matter the most, and you can use AI to help you get to that like we'll be getting into brand kits and design kits later. And this is just like a lot of back information that we will be kind of feeding to the AI. So it knows what to talk about or at least how to talk about the things we want to talk about. I think that's a better way to put it so like, let me take a step back, really quick. And I'm creating this video right now as part of my build in public series where I'm building out my content repurposing system, which, like here's part of it. But essentially it takes a zoom call or any kind of long form. Video turns it into a bunch of different clips, right? So it formats them, finds the best moments. Things like that cuts it from the video. If you ever used opus clips, it's kind of the same thing as that. But just like done programmatically. Then turns each one of those clips in different quotes, Facebook posts, Linkedin posts, emails like whatever you want. and then puts all of that oops wrong. One. Here's some tests I was doing. I just finished putting the auto scheduling part in here. Oh, finish putting the on scheduling part in here. So like we'll be building more of this out. And now what I'm doing is coming back and updating all of my prompts. So I've got this prompt stock here. And what's really cool about the system I built is that any anything that has a copywriter as the job role. It's going to use a clip transcript and create content around that. Right? So I've got what was this one social post quotes is that it? Okay, email brain dump, not using that, the Oprah plant beta, not using that. Yeah. So what I'm gonna be doing is updating these prompts, maybe change them up, doing a few different ones, and likely this will be in part 2 or 3 that we get into some of like the actual, like redoing of these prompts. But I just got all the automation parts up, especially like this auto publishing bit. And now I'm ready to come back and work through oops. That's a creature, the copywriter. This goes to a different post. That does all that. But coming to update those prompts so that I now actually have really cool stuff that I can post. And that's what brings us here. And that's why I'm talking about all this prompt AI conversation stuff. Because I think one of the most important skills that we can start to develop as humans is learning how to talk to AI, because the fact of the matter is, it's only going to become a bigger and bigger part of the world we live in. It is going to be one of the greatest unlocks of prosperity that we have seen. I am a big believer in that. I I don't think there's another way that it can go with how things are right now. And that's a video for another time. But I I am very. very hopeful, very pro AI. I think it's gonna do a lot of cool things, and we can get into all that in another video if people want to hear my thoughts on that. But for now what I can talk really well about is how you talk to these models, because I've had hundreds and hundreds of conversations with them over the last 2 years. I spend 4 h plus a day, you know. I'd say at least 5 to 6 days a week. I spend 4 h plus talking with AI over the last 2 years. So I have have figured out a thing or 2, and that's really the biggest, the biggest thing that I see when people are struggling with using AI is that they just don't know how to talk to it right? Like they'll put in, maybe a prompt like this to get started. And that's it. Right? They'll they'll look at this and be like, Oh, this is whatever I don't like it. It's okay. Take what it is, and it's like. There's so much more. There's so much more that you can do with all this right like this is not even scratching the surface. But what I will say. What I will say is, if you are a brand new coach like you just got into this you know. I don't know. You teach underwater basket weaving. Right? Let's let's say you teach underwater basketball. You have. AI create a post like this. You never done any marketing before. You've just been a social media lurker. You know you want to like. Everybody loves your underwater baskets and think they're so cool. So you start doing as a thing right. Whatever teach other people how to do it. I would post this right if I if I don't know anything about content creation, copywriting, what I'm supposed to do like. I'll read through like reading through this. I'm like, Wow, like it says all the things that like I need it to say. And this actually kind of scared me because it's like I felt like I knew a little bit more than it should, but apparently with the new cloud updates over the last couple days it's instituted. A similar kind of memory feature is Chatgpt. That's 1 of the coolest things about Chat Gpt right now is that it has memory so it can look back at your previous conversations and kind of get to know you and store things about you that you talk about frequently and are important. You know my chat. Gpt knows me very, very well. If you use chat, gpt a lot, ask it to roast you, and don't let it get off with the 1st one. It'll probably be pretty weak, but be like no, no, really roast me. I want you to take the gloves off and just like, go for it. It's funny. It's funny. It's got some good stuff. So a lot of cool things you can do with AI once it has that memory component in there, right? So talking about like a few few of these different things just like, oh, I remember talking about that before, so you can do some cool stuff right off the bat, just saying those things right. You see, it's got a good structure. It adds emojis in there. So it's clear to read. But if you're someone who's been in the online coaching space for a minute, or just kind of done any kind of marketing. You'll very quickly see the holes in this, and how it's pretty generic, and sounds exactly like something a Guru marketing guru or coaching, Guru would like say or put together as like a template post for you to go fill out like being in the industry for a minute. It's just like, Oh, my God! This reeks of like all the things that scream marketing coach, there are a few things I like in there. yeah, this is. This is a really good part. What they're eating. Best test secret. I kind of like that, you know, this lead and Intro is very weak. There's nothing intriguing or exciting about it. And you know, and that's something we're like. AI really fails that kind of out of the box. You have to get a lot of instructions. And tell, you know, like more context, right? That's that's the thing that we'll kind of really be getting into with all this and going back and forth talking a lot about AI writes bad content. Because can I go over a little bit? Oh, wait! Hold on! If any of you guys have a remarkable, that's what I'm using right now. And it's the 1st time I've used it on the computer with color. Oh, that's cool. Right? So lack of context is why AI writes bad content period full stop. That is really what's going on here is you haven't given enough context. It cannot read your mind. so it doesn't know what to put right like. I didn't watch a coach do this last week, you know, and I have no idea what I did last week. But yeah, but because I finally built a fit system, I wish existed when I was growing up like, Yeah, I wish that is true. I wish I had this. This is why I built it out. You know. Here's what most Gurus won't tell you. It's such a typical Guru line. Your content salary happening every single day. It's in your coach. Go like, I like this a lot, right? This is this is a really good good section there, really dropping gold in your zoom, you know, dropping gold. That's kind of cliche. Yeah, this could be useful right? Like, that's while you're stressing, you know, like stressing out what to post tomorrow. It's very common pain point for coaches, content creators, things like that so not bad. We could we could do something better with it? Quick question with every time you hit and mean on zoom, right? So like this is a pretty good section here, right? It could be used better, or we can lead into it a little bit better. Without lifting a finger without hiring a Bia without learning complicated software again like this is very, very, very copy paste, template Guru type. Speak here. Theory, right? That is a very Guru transition. It's cool that like AI is picking up on this stuff. Right? I think, like, take a second to appreciate that just asking it to write a viral Facebook post for online coaches like the little context I gave it. yeah, this is very much structured, like a coaching industry post that I've seen over and over again. Very, very similar frame frameworks. Look, I get it again. Guru transition. Like I said, before, I like. I like this this part a lot. this isn't bad, right? So overall overall. If you've never done this before like post, it like this would be something way better than like a Newbie coach who just like found the industry quit their 9 to 5, you know, whatever. So it's not bad. But we can do a lot a lot better. and you know what. Let's try that once, because I have another thing I'm going to show you. But this could be a fun exercise. Really, quick, if anybody noticed this little thing here, this is whisper flow highly. Highly. Recommend it. It is an awesome software. and just make me a little smaller over here. Boom! Awesome. Whisper flows off software. So you basically can hold hold on your fn key and it will start and then dictate in the mouse, but it uses a little bit of AI to clean up the speech, and actually like writes it out well, because you know how we talk. We'll drop a like and and this thing and that thing we might. There's been times where I've kind of like stumbled over my words like, oh, no, that's not it. And it will actually take that part out and kind of clean up. So it's super cool, highly recommend. You've got a hand. You know a lock feature to where you hit the space bar and just like talk for a while. So if you ever use the built in Mac. Dictation thing. It kind of sucks because, like after a while, just like wig out and stop writing. And also like, I think, it's speech to text capabilities. Aren't that great like AI is real? Or, excuse me, Apple's really shit the bed on AI, which is a topic for another day. But whisper flow is 100% worth in awesome really, big fan. They also have like a a notes feature, too. So you can just like record yourself for a while. So if you use like otter or something like that, this could probably replace it. So what I'm gonna do here is. start the conversation right? Because it's like too many people would take this. and if you're a good marketing, be like, oh, this is garbage. I wouldn't use this blah blah and say, AI sucks, or if you're a Newbie marketer, or like Newbie coach, you'll be like, Oh, this is pretty good. I'll use this. But if we continue the conversation, if we treat AI more like an agency partner or a contractor that we work with you, you wouldn't just like. say this sucks like I'm not going to use it. I'll talk to you next time, right like, if you pay a contractor for content, and you don't like it. What are you? Gonna do you tell them what you don't like? Ask them to redo it. That's what AI is going to do right? The main difference here with AI is one. It's gonna do exactly what you tell it and nothing else. 2 is going to do a lot faster and 3. It's not going to complain or get butt hurt that you want some changes made right. And and I say that as a copywriter who has worked with clients for 10 years and been paid a lot of money to write content. And you know, I've been paid $5,000 to write 5 emails before I get a little butter. Sometimes, if I give something to a client like I don't really like this part I'm like, but I really do right. And at the end of the day it's 1 of those things where, like humans, will always have an ego or bias into it. AI will only have the ego or bias that you give it. So you can kind of train some of these things out of it. And I will show you. Yeah, we'll just show you that right now. So the 1st thing I did is alright. Let's go to the left side. So we got this up, and you see right above that we got. Oh, dang it! Go back! Go back! Go back! I was close one hopefully. You see that. So this is another cloud version, this is my desktop, and you see I have this everyday OS content. Creator, let's go back here. Boom! So this is a Claude project. So anytime I talk to Claude in here, it's going to automatically apply this system prompt. And it's going to have this in its memory. Right? This is my prompt stock. These are all the prompts I'm working with. That showed you right here. We've got my brand kit. which is this. So this gives a bunch of information about the AI that will be changing up a ton and then design Kit. That's not the pretty version. There you go. Here's a pretty version. So got the design kit. And this is basically the brand kit. But for visual stuff, right? And this are basically just very detailed instructions, right? So tells it gives a little bit context, high level, what we're doing. user request. I gotta update this. I don't think this quite works in Claude. I'm not 100% sure, because I'm pretty positive it's not pulling. I don't know. That's part of what we're going to be going over in the next video here. And then just like, if I was working with, you know, junior copywriter, Va, we video editor, whoever you want to give them a series of step-by-step instructions. Right? Analyze the requests, search for matching prompts, select a prompt create a custom, prompt if needed, right. And that's a really cool thing. And why I like using Claude, for this is because it has very good agentic features. Which means, I can, you know, without creating some complicated workflow or automation. Just give it all of my prompts in that prompt doc. Right? So we have. You know, all these prompts in here that we're going to expand out, you know some of these short ones are just for clipping animation and don't really need a prompt. They're just yeah the games that another time but it can go through select a prompt, if no suitable, prompt matches, it will create a custom prompt to go through it right? And figure out the thing based on these structures. transformation, right? So like, oh, this is actually a good thing to to go over. I am a big believer that we, as marketers, coaches, content creators should not be relying on AI to create original content for us. It can help us with the ideation, phase, and all of that. But to have AI write something for you from scratch, I think, is not a very good idea, right? As we were kind of we showed in this. It's not great. And I'll show you why. In a second, even with like some extra stuff, it's still in But what instead we should do is use it to transform our own words. Right? So if you don't know, chat, gpt, the Gpt. Stands for. Oh, my God! I forgot something. General purpose, transformer right keyword, there being transformer, it transforms one thing into another. It transforms your input into what it thinks is the desired output, right? So the reason that AI gets harped on for having this like soulless generic content. That it writes is because you give it soulless generic inputs, right like there's no, there's nothing. There's nothing in this right. There's no soul in this. There's nothing about me in here that you could feel like right if you knew me, and like knew the content. I wrote for myself, read my Facebook page, saw my Instagram videos. Things like that. You would read this and be like that doesn't sound like Fran like that's not. That's not. That's not him at all right. But I didn't give it anything about me. I didn't. But if you start with like here, my system is set up so that it takes where is it? Right? It'll take the transcript from one of these and turns that into into different pieces of content. Right? So it takes my own words and turns into the content. Right? So it has something about me. It knows something about me, and that's what makes AI really cool and powerful, plus then you can just get into like the content multiplication we'll get into that in just a second. So this is the second draft, and you worry about that. you'll see this is a much longer conversation. So I started the conversation. My everyday OS content Creator Project, which has that background? Info about me. That more extensive prompt. And is that how you spell rubric? Hmm! Learn something new every day. So yeah, basically, all I did took this output here. I said, I need you to analyze the attached piece of content that had written by an Llm. And tell me all the ways in which it sucks and needs to be improved, especially as far as the hook and lead go. We need that to be a lot more interesting and just generally make it more on Brand. First, st I need to grade out rubric, then find the ways that we can improve it whoops so no, my gosh. those are. Those are totally relevant for what we're doing here. So don't worry about that So one thing that I think it would be a really good exercise to do if you're just learning about AI, and how to talk to it is come up with some sort of content, grading rubric based on whatever matters to you. Right like. I will work on a prompt that is more of like a specific copy chief that has more instructions on how I want to grade it. But for now, just like, for the example of this. whatever rubric is fine, and I was actually pretty impressed with this as I read through it, because I was much, much nicer to the output from this than this was right like I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good, like much better than I thought it was. Gonna be. I'm like, you know, it's nothing amazing. It's nothing amazing. But I'm like, shit. I'll post it just to see what happens. and then I start re they send through here and start reading this and go grade d plus 38 out of 100. And what that showed me really kind of plainly is like my own biases towards AI. Right like I'm very pro AI is really changed my life in the last 2 years, and helped me in so many ways. I've been struggling with like my copy career. It also is like already taken my job more or less to the point where, like, I've spent the last 2 years learning automation and basic computer programming. So that like, I can create systems like this instead of losing clients to AI. But so what that means because humans always have biases and egos. I wanted to be. And this this is all like, I went. I went through this, live in the last video that I forgot to record. So make sure you hit record creators. And I went through this live. And it really made me realize like, oh, dang like, because I want other people to be as excited about AI as I am. I want to kind of like talk this up more so that people get more excited. And be like, Oh, yeah, that's really not that bad, right? Because we're very influenced. And very influential creatures, right? It's easy for us to like influence and get excited about things like based on what other people say or prior experiences. Blah blah! But when I told AI, tell me all the ways in which this sucks right, and it doesn't care. It doesn't have an ego, it doesn't, you know. Like, if I would take this back to a copywriter if a client would like. Come back to me and be like, Hey. not bad. But now I want you to like. Find all the ways, sucks. and like everything that you can do to improve it. I'm like, Oh, my God, really! Are you fucking? Kidding me like no, yeah, it doesn't care. And if I didn't like this like I could have a redo it. You know a lot of times I will change this 1st prompt like 4, 5, 6 times before continuing on the conversation. You know, just taking different things. I've learned from this right? So maybe right like, let's see, what is the rubric we have hook, brand, alignment, content, quality, audience, resonance. Cta, and we can, I mean shit. Let's even just extensive rubric experienced copy. Chief. Let's update and see that. Oh. and while it's doing all this to go back to you know an easy way to learn to use AI or like understand AI better is to do different like grading rubrics. And if you come up with like either rubric that you already use, or, you know, go, look something up and kind of modify that for your purposes, and then kind of feed that into AI with either like content that you've made in the past. you know something you're making right now, and just be like, Hey, analyze this based on the rubric, and tell me which ways it can improve right? And that's a good way to start to understand how AI is looking at your content and thinking about it. and then you can also, too, like you know, there, there are things that I struggle with. Still, right. I've written millions and millions of words, but there's certain things that I don't do well because of how I think about the world, and having an AI rubric in here kind of great, and be like making sure like, Hey, is this hook actually interesting, right? Like, will this be interesting to everybody else, or just to me? So stuff like that. So let's see, we'll go through Go through here content, analysis, custom, analysis, framework, right? And that could be something. Here, let's do this. Please give me the full and complete, detailed, prompt. that you came up with slash created to do this rubric grading analysis that screwed up one to do. Oh, there we go! Whisper, whisper, flow has been weird about stopping. So we'll do that while we go through here. So great d plus all right detail, rubric assessment hook and lead 5 out of 20 generic. I just watched opening, tired, overused fake relatability play with the scream Emoji 0 pattern, interrupt or curiosity. App takes 4 paragraphs to get to any value, like no unique angle or fresh perspective like this harsh stuff. Right? Could you imagine sitting here and having someone like grade your work like this brand alignment. 3 out of 20. Vital didn't know anything about my brand. So of course, like. it's not going to like, it's going to fail this like horrifically but it just kind of goes to show that like, if you write a piece of content and you have a brand kit with it like you can include that in your your content, like, you know. Like, if you're a freelancer. write copy for clients like Create brand kit for a client, and then use AI to make sure that whatever you write for them like follows like on brand right? So missing all this, which no kidding structure and flow 8 out of 15 uses. Line breaks and format. That's that's a bit, but must have right. Must have done it well. Wall of text and nice sections. No, but therefore transition as required, that's part of my brand. So I highly recommend looking into the careers of South Park. They've got a great little video on Youtube like called Story Structure. You know, it's just Youtube, like, how like South Park story structure or something like that, my Youtube's blocked right now because it's gonna focus But they have this great, this great philosophy that if you can say, and then between different beats of a story. You know, different section scenes of a story you've got a pretty boring story it should be filled with, but and therefore right. So it's like. I spent the entire week coming up with all these prompts that I thought was going to help have AI create the best content for me. But after I saw the 1st thing it put out. I just wanted to walk away from this whole thing. I I don't know like that was, that was not a good thing, but you get the idea, the the but is to kind of something needs to happen right? Like we. We have to. We have to make sure that there, there's something happening that is interesting and and interesting things are those that get in the way of what we think. The obvious outcome should be right like if I'm starting to a conversation of like, Oh, my God, I love AI. I've spent all this time creating these prompts, and you know, really poured my heart and soul into it. Been working on prompt engineering and stuff like that for a while. But you're like, Oh, my God, what happened right? That's kind of what it is. Value delivery all sizzle. No steak doesn't teach anything right. I'm a big believer in teaching. First, st you know. You give value that way. No frameworks, prompts or actionable tactics list benefits clearly doesn't demonstrate expertise just claims it. That's a big thing that's kind of included in my brain. Kids like show. Don't tell psychological triggers. Fomo is present. Social proof attempt, though generic. right? Fake scarcity, only 10 coaches. This is the one I'd like push back on a little bit. simply because, like the way I run this like I, I'm working with clients on their prompts a lot. So I do. Do limit it. Pushy cta! Despite claiming no pushy tactics. Let me see here, what is the Cta. Let's see if you're done with, and you're ready for I mean I don't know if I'd call it called this pushy so it might be a little little over the top on that one, but still right like, if we can prove it, we can prove it. Originally it could be written by any automation service cookie, cutter, coach marking template, drop seriously in 2025 right Ps. Structure is painfully predictable. Credibility. 5 out of 10 fake claims without specifics. Last week story feels manufactured right totally is numbers, provided no mention of actual tech process. real truth. What sucks the most right like. even if you had like an editor, you know you're working working at bigger copy place, or you know, you hire a copy coach like it's often hard for people to give this sort of like direct feedback. And personally, like, I like direct feedback like this, right? Like, I don't need things sugarcoat like. Just tell me what's wrong, and like we can start to fix it like, is it gonna hurt? I'm gonna feel a little upset about it. Yes, but I'm a big boy. I'll get over it so like. I want it to talk to me like this. And if I you know when I spend time creating a more detailed rubric. then it will have even more clear instructions on how to do this. So like, let's just go over what we got here. What sucks the most. The opening is doa. I just watched a coach spend 4 h. This is the. It was a dark and stormy night of marketing copy. Every coach automation tool starts with a you're immediately forgettable. Right? And this is a good reminder. Right? This is a good reminder. I just watched, you know, like you are forgettable. And you need to know that emoji diarrhea. I like this. Your brand, Kit says sparingly. This post has 15 plus emojis. It looks like a 2019 Mlm. Pitch AI is starting to get funny. The fake, reluctant Guru voice. Here's the truth. Most Gurus won't tell you while writing exactly like every Guru, the irony is painful. Oh, this is good, this is really good, right? And and again, like this is without much context of like a rubric. I just like an extensive rubric and experienced copy chief or editor would use right? 0 demonstration of expertise. You claim to be tech savvy, but never mentioned what Amls use, how automation actually works specific tools or workflows any technical insight whatsoever. Right? And this is good feedback but also not exactly accurate. And this comes back to the context of like. what demonstration of expertise means in this context? Right? Because coaches probably don't care that much about what AI model I use. How the automation actually works like, no one wants me to come in and start explaining what all these different nodes do right? Like I. All this stuff. And a lot of this. And a lot of this is just Bs stuff that you don't need to know. It's like prep stuff, right? It's this, make sure that we have the files we need. Right? This, make sure we have the context. We need looks for clips. This one formats it right, then brings it back through here to edit again, then formats it again. Then to, you know, so like all this, all this stuff that you don't no one cares about right. But what we do want to demonstrate and show of expertise, you know, would be more along the lines of that. We understand how to leverage AI to fill those content gaps that most coaches, you know, are falling into right, whether you don't have the extra budget to hire a big content team that can edit all your videos. Right? You know. So like most coaches, likely can hire an editor that might edit what one video a week, 2 videos a week, something like that. Not 10. Right? But AI, let's do 10 videos a week. Let's do every single video. For you know, fraction of the price. So showing how you can take AI use different prompts things like that to really leverage your content output and test a bunch of different things like that's how I would talk about like demonstrating expertise generic benefits list. Very true, the fair warning section. This might feel like cheating cringe. This is 2015 copywriting. Fake scarcity. Again, I would. Your brand is about democratizing. AI, not false exclusivity. Okay, this is a really great point. Right? So I would, you know, like I I would push back on this for sure. Still. because I do think 10 is real and legitimate, you know, onboarding more than 10 people with the system right now. It does still take a minute to set up, and you know it is an ongoing thing at the moment to keep improving, and stuff like that. So like I would do, I would say 10 is good, but it brings up a good point. Your brand is about democratizing AI, not false exclusivity. So that would tell me what I should be doing in that line is a better job of explaining why there are only 10 spots available which can also help boost credibility and likelihood of someone saying, Yes, because, you know, the reason is is that I give more time and attention. To people. And that's another cool thing about like AI, and what it will allow us to do, as far as like making money. I don't like managing people. I've done it both in retail settings like face to face. And for different, like online companies I've worked with. And I just don't like managing people period. I don't want to manage people. I want to do as much as I can as a sole entrepreneur, which obviously means that there will be caps in what I can do. Income! I can make things like that. But at the end of the day I'm not willing to make those sacrifices in quality and customer service that you know you just have to, as you scale and hire other people and do stuff like that's not something I want to do like. I want to be in the trenches like building things, working on clients stuff and make it better and better. Right? I love. I love writing. I love writing, and I love being able to produce cool content. more, better, faster with AI. So that's what I want to do. And this is very real. This is very real right now, and 10 people in the next month here. So I need to just give it some more context how to fix this mess. All right. new hook options. Let's see option. A technical entry. Yesterday I fed a 47 min zoom recording to Gpt. 4 with a 2. I mean, that's like super specific. What happened next broke my content calendar in the best way. Right? So if I was making content more, maybe for like automation people right like, if my goal was to sell this like specifically to like other automation. people who just want like a plug and play system that they can learn how to install for clients like I might. I might go with this one option B. Contrarian data coaches who post daily make 40% less than coaches, who post twice a week unless they're using this one prompt system that I I don't like that one. That one just sounds stupid like if you post more like, you're probably going to do better than someone who posts twice a week. So AI doesn't always get it. Story with specifics. France just turned one zoom call into force and piece content, using 3 chat gpt prompts and a Google sheet time invested 8 min. Here's the exact workflow again. Not that great. It's funny. I actually got a lot better responses from the last, the last one which I'll show you in a second. Alright we got for voice fixes. Now kill every emoji yup and technical specifics maybe release one actual, prompt or framework. It's actually not a terrible idea. It's actually not a terrible idea. Maybe what I do is like link to I don't know like I could. If you know, if I want to go like the extra mile I could link to like a meta prompt so that people can like create their own brand. Kit. Kind of thing, reference, and atlas a bit subtly. These are. I have some characters like I'm playing with. I need to redo this because I don't quite like the characters as they are. But I like the idea of having characters in my content. You sure paragraphs? Yup. Current ones are novels, I mean, are they really alright. I guess. Depending. Yeah, I mean, like, if you consider all this like one paragraph and social media, right? structure, overhaul. Yep, yep, get value in 51st words show the system, don't just promise it. Include a mini tutorial, prompt. Make a Cta about learning, not buying brand align reframe instead of coach struggling with content position as explored, discovering untapped content. Gold in their zoom. Vault fits your adventure theme. Perfectly right. So here's here's something that's like kind of really worth mentioning like, why gain your brand kit? Right? Is important. I don't think this is something. Wait! What's that like? I am not like Brand was never a big thing for me, most of my career. It's only been the last couple of years that I've really started to be like. Oh, damn! I really kind of screwed that one up, not building more of a brand But here, like explore discovering untapped content and gold in their zoom vault fits your adventure theme perfectly. That was my 1st idea of what I want to do for my brand kit and my brand, and what I've kind of been playing with like. Here, let's see, right? So it creates stuff like this. I would say. This is probably my favorite of all of them. Right. I have a few different themes. I wanted to try try out a few different things, so like I've been playing with what I want for brand stuff quite a bit. And now I just need to come back and kind of like solidify it. But, like overall, I've not been totally digging these characters. so we'll go back through and fix it. And that's the cool thing with AI, too. Right? Like, I can create multiple different brands. And that's actually like, kind of what I'm going to be doing with another series is creating just new brand accounts of I don't know different topics and things like that, and start creating content and growing those channels just for shits and giggles and proof of concept And I don't. I don't want to do the explore discovering untapped content, golden or zoom vaults, like as I read, I'm like, that sounds kind of cringey. We're gonna have to give some different details there. Bottom line. This reads like every coach to coach pitch from 2020. Your brain is about pragmatic tech, savvy empowerment with playful challenger voice. This post is neither pragmatic nor playful playful. It's just pushy. Start over with your actual expertise, the technical how to that. Others won't share. Right. So we're gonna go back to the other conversation in just a second. But I do want to kind of show you how Claude, being such a good agentic model, and, if you remember, from here we had search for matching prompts, select a prompt create, a custom, prompt if needed. and then execute, execute the transformation right? And if we look, this prompt a lot longer than I thought is very clearly not not in here. You are, bell hardened copy, chief, with 25 years experience. Right? Let's see. Oh, Video, blueprint builder. So we've got copy chief here. But that's as far as like videos go. What's right now, that's the Xml version. Yeah. So I mean, like, we don't have this prompt in here, this created this create, this prompt and basically use it. What was it? This exact specific, prompt? It used when it came up with this 1st one? I don't know if we look through here. let's see from the brand kit, right? So like pulled stuff from the brand Kit key issues, I'm already seeing generic Guru, right? So it's not following this like specific brand below. And that's why, again, it's important to use prompts. But if if I want, if I really like this, want to use this for other content. now I have the prompt right? I have version one of this. I can look through it. And anything that like, you know. Let's see hook and lead 20 points values 1st 3 seconds. you know, I might change this from 3 seconds to 3 sentences. Right? Since it'll have a better idea of like a sentence versus the seconds. Here pattern interrupt. Is it unexpected, fresh, right? I would probably like detail this out more and be like, what does unexpected fresh mean in the context of, you know. coaching online education, Curia Gap. What question does it create, you know, might give some examples here. Things like that. So this gives you a really really good place to start. and you can keep working from there. And now this is the 1st one, right? And this is pretty similar. I actually liked. I like this rubric better than the second one generic. I watch someone waste time openings your intrigue. You don't really need to go. Oh, this is good, right? Some valid points identified, benefits clearly listed, though generic logical flow exists. But during cliches and emoji spam blah blah critical issues, right? This. This focused a little bit better on the hook and opening and gave me some different suggestions this way. Right? So redemption path rather than creating a a whole new post right away. This focus, like I said on the hooks. Better option. One parent interrupt your zoom. Recurrents are worth $47,000. You just don't know it yet. This could be good if it was true, right? It obviously took it from the original post which is assumed to be true. But I don't. I don't have anything to back up the $47,000 yet. I could take this as painting kind of a scenario or situation showing how. You know either a case study about how a client made more money, and you know, updated to the appropriate number. Another way is just like painting a picture of like, Hey, this is how like your zoom recordings have all this extra content. If you post more content, you're gonna probably get more clients, you know, like extrapolate your current. kpis Roi's from your content now and like, let's say, that holds. But you start producing 10 times the amount of content, you know, like you go route like routes like that. I like this one last Tuesday bit, analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot does it now? Right? That's kind of a nice fun. But therefore, type of thing, it's not a true but it does, however, have that kind of contrast there. It's like, oh, I create an automation content automation system. But I'm done creating content forever. Like, what? What do you mean? So I might excuse me, you know. Maybe something changed changing this or adding to it where it'd be like. Last Tuesday, after finishing my content automation system and having bit analyzed my coaching calls, found something that made me quit creating content forever. I don't know something like that. And that's something I'll come back to in just a second after we go through option. 3. The Contrarian tooth. I like this one a lot. This is very much more me and my style, and like how I like to talk and talk to people. Stop creating content seriously. Stop what your conversations do instead. So it gives some good stuff, right? And again, this is all based on my brand kit, and if I don't like this you know, I can add stuff to my brand kit to get to get closer. I want just like, if I was working with contractor Va employee agency each time that we go through and create new content, you know, like they're updating their files. And you're like, Okay, we like this. We don't like that like this. Don't like that. Do the same thing with AI. See, Brand align, we don't really well. don't really need to go through all this stuff. Kind of similar to the last one with the critiques. But you know, just start with impossible sign claim use. But therefore, Max, 3 sentences per sections your decorative language. Oh, these were funny challenge. Don't coddle. You're either automating or you're cosplaying as va like this actually made me laugh out loud the 1st time. I don't know if y'all find it funny. But I do. I'm trying to get AI to put a little more humor into it. Your competitors use system. You use hope, it's a little bit too, on the nose. Every manual post is a choice to stay small. That one's kind of funny, too. Like if you could work that in a little bit differently, I think that could could be a funny. A funny thing I feel like this would be. Hmm! You would almost like I could see this being fun as like a parody of like a bro marketing thing, you know, like. have a guy pretending to be like super Bro and buff, be like every manual post, is a choice to stay small. You know, kind of like one of those bodybuilder type things anyways. So this we're just gonna kind of like, totally skip over. It it my part of my direction. The brand kit is like. I like to keep things concise. Economy of words, you know. Don't use fluff stuff like that, and I should specify this out a bit more. because I don't want, you know, like is too short. Right? It's it's interpreting what I meant by concise incorrectly, and again, like as I was kind of looking through my brand kit, I'm not 100% sure where, how or what is causing it to do that in here ruthless edits probably would be part of it. Pragmatic. Yeah, I think you know some of those some of those might do it. But and also, too, like I didn't want a paragraph post right? It just didn't know from the 1st conversation over here where I asked for the long form specifically right. It's telling me here's a compelling long form, but this doesn't know that I wanted long form. It just knows I got a long form. So it's like, Oh, we should shorten this next steps. Here's some of the rewrites, I'm like, okay, sure fine, but that's not exactly it. And what I like to do. And this has been a complete game changer with whisper, whisper, flow, now is you just start the conversation right? So, you know, do the fn and spacebar. and go back through this prompt and just talk through what I like, what I don't like what I agree with, what I disagree with anything I want changed stuff like that. right? And look at this. Look at this context like this was just for me talking, you know, and imagine, like most people just like typing this out aren't going to type this much, just, you know, simply because, like it's take a while, takes a minute but instead, like, I can just talk through all this and just be like I like this part. I don't like that part. This is kind of what I'm going for. Blah blah blah! And then and then a little little hack little secret that I love to use and finish off a lot of my prompts with is. ask me any follow-up questions. Come on. ask me any. Follow up questions you need to in order to be 90% confident, you can make the necessary updates to really make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like this for them. So the important part is, ask me questions until you're 90% confident you can effect. Can dot dot right? don't go above 90 do like 80% if you want to. But like 80, 90% is good, anything above 90, it just gets like too detailed. So what you're basically saying here is like, what contacts are you missing that you need to create the post I want? And if you gave it like some decent input before and tell you like, what your goal is, what you're trying to do things like that. And we'll get more into this into like conversation structure in the next video. But what it's what we're doing here is asking like, what other details do you need to know what are the things you know about me. To make this really good. And you can simply say, like to effectively, you know, 90% confident to effectively help me create this or finish this task, finish this project whatever like. I like being a little bit more explicit in these things because it does help kind of guide the AI and like what to think about right? Like 90% confident you can make the necessary updates to make. And I should take really out of there. But who cares to make an effective Facebook post that will have people reaching out to me to create content like that for them? Right. The ultimate goal that I want is an effective Facebook post that will help people have people reaching out to me. Right? So what do you need to know to be 90% confident that you can do that. Create that Facebook post. And it will ask right? It's not going to groan. It's not going to be like, oh, my God! You want me to rewrite it again, or do this again. So it was great feedback. I need to figure out like, well, I don't know this kind of feels nice, but you know, these being a helpful assistant, they can be a bit sycophantic. And will usually tell you. That's good, right? Otherwise. So you do have to take a bit of critical thinking and make sure it's actually right and not just blowing smoke up your ass. It's really important to do like, I don't recommend using AI to create content around subjects that you aren't familiar with, because it will do a really really good job writing something that is complete, 100% bullshit, or just like off the mark of what's kind of like, accurate and true. It'll sound really good and like, if you don't know, like the industry like, yeah, that that totally makes sense. But then you hand it to the client. They're like the this isn't right. You're like fuck. So just make sure that, like you do know what you're talking about. Before you have AI do it so you can proofread in that And then what I did in the last video that I didn't record is essentially took whisper flow like I talked about before. started it, and just read through these and just kind of answered the questions right and talk through this. You mentioned your accomplishments, writing 10 million words, any specific client transformations, your own content, metrics. real systems, metrics. Right? We don't need to go into this at the moment. It's probably a little bit too in depth, on, like how I think about things. But what you can see and what is important to point out here is because I use whisper, flow. Look at these answers right? Like this is a lot of context that I'm giving it and able to give it super easily, because all I did was start it. And then, just, you know, like, read through and brain dumped. Yeah, I'm like, no, this isn't right. I'd like this to do this instead. Blah blah. So it gives all that. And I haven't actually read the updated version yet. So let's we'll go through that together and see what what we come up with. So here we go 1st off quick, naming suggestions so like one of the things I did want to use, because, like, I don't want to do sales calls initially, or frame them as sales calls and don't I excuse me. I want to instead do it as a like brand Kit design type call where we help build out like their brand kit design kit. and then a minute, prompt that people can use and try it out and create content for them, and then have the sales call kind of thing. So ask for some naming ideas. I don't like voice mining call, but I do like content. DNA session. That's kind of a good one. The mining like. I don't know how I could get content. DNA mining I don't know but content set DNA session sounds pretty good. We can run with that version. One wake up, call level 10 sas, alright. Let's see. Oh, yeah, that was the other thing, too. Really, quickly is tone calibration. I would definitely say, like my true authentic energy, is the 10 full. Wake up. You're doing everything wrong. Type of thing. I can be very to the point. and blunt in that respect with a bit of disregard, for like social norms, social conventions. And you know it's 1 of those things where. when you're creating content, you know I know the the trope is like, be authentic, be authentic and like yes, absolutely. But like, how authentic do you need to be in that like. I have a whole life outside of, like what I do here, and what I post that I don't talk about just because it's a not relevant and be like, not things that like I want to talk about right? Is that like inauthentic? I'm not sharing my entire life. I don't know, maybe, but you don't need to know that stuff right there. There is a specific business purpose. That I am creating this content for like, yes, I am trying to help people. So I do want to make sure that, like it catches their attention in a way that makes them open to receiving my ideas rather than just like shove in your face. You're doing wrong right? So we'll see what this full wake up. You're doing everything wrong, energy is. And then the other one I asked for like something that's more in like the 5 to 6 range, like a little. It's balanced, but it's just like a little tip towards towards the Sas here. So I'm curious to see what it does in that respect. you know, and kind of how it compares right? And that comes back to like your own, like understanding your own personal, like biases, flaws, worldviews and things like that. It's like knowing the ways in which you think about, and present yourself to the world that might not be effective, helpful, or beneficial to your bigger goals, you know, whether, again, like could be creating. You know, some sort of dollar value that you're looking for. It could be an impact. It could be a freedom, you know. That's the thing, I think, is really awesome about AI is more and more. People will have the ability to create lifestyle businesses. Right? You know, we, I think we're going to see kind of an end to the make millions of dollars in 90 day. Yeah, we're we're already seeing a lot of that like make money online stuff fizzle out. But I think it's going to come back even more. To the point where you will see a lot more people, you know, making just average income online, creating content about specific topics or things that they're interested account interested. On different accounts. Right? So we'll see more of that in the future. And where's I going with that one? I don't know. But oh, the the business purpose right? So like. Let's see what level 10 sas gets us. And if that's a little bit too over the top. So version one. oh. yeah, we'll get into this. We'll get this. I'll come back to that second stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do it instead. Because right now you're cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running systems, and every manual post you create is a choice to stay small. harsh, good. Someone needs to say it. Last Tuesday bit analyzed my coaching call and found something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the bot army handles it. Now. here's what bit discovered. You're performing the same conversation 5 times a week and creating 0 content from it. Meanwhile you're staring at Canva at 11 Pm. Trying to remember what font you used last time, Atlas, nearly short, circuited when he mapped out the ways. Think about it. Monday. Strategy session with a client gone. Tuesday group coaching masterclass, deleted Wednesday sales call where you drop your best framework banished. Thursday. Interview, where you explained your entire methodology. Poof! Friday workshop, where every set everyone said, mind blowing dust. 3 min of pure gold. 0 content cried. But you'll spend your weekend batching content. Aka! Panic cream, mediocre posts. I like that. You're either automating or you're larping as your own intern huh! Choose. I like that part a lot. I do like that. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice. Every zoom call you do contains 12 to 15 story loops. Android chaperone will weep with joy. 8 to 10 contrarian insights. Your audience needs 20 quotable moments that would stop scrolls 3 to 5. Complete teaching frameworks. Enough email sequences to nurture leads for month within 1 h of hitting end meeting bidden Atlas can extract all of it. Bitmaps, narrative structure, atlas, cuts, formats, and deploys. You go have lunch. But Francis AI. Content is garbage. You're right. Those write viral posts with AI tools, absolute trash. I've tested them all. They pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration porn that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune cookie. I like this a lot. I don't know if you all think this is funny, but I am. I'm a fan. that's not what this is. Here's what separates this from every other AI content scam. I spent 10 years running over 10 million words that generated 10 million dollars in revenue for clients, real campaigns, real business, real money. I know it converts. And what's just noise. So I build your custom prompts. They're not templates. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. I like this. They're precision instruments calibrated to your voice. We spend a session extracting your content. DNA. I build custom brand kits, design kits, and prompts your system, learns your frameworks, your language, your edge, then every one to 2 weeks we refine it together, because good enough is the enemy of extraordinary. The coaches who get this are already ahead. While you're finding your voice. They're everywhere. While you're planning content. They're closing deals while you're building consistency. They've already won. not because they're better coaches because they realize coaching calls are content. Creation, truth bomb. So this is like, well, all right. I'll come back to that. I so I want to read through all this before I start critiquing. It's really hard, though. Truth bomb. I built this system because I spent 4 years watching brilliant coaches fail, not because they couldn't coach, because they couldn't market, and I was tired of seeing mediocre coaches with great marketing eat their lunch. The world needs more good coaches, not more good marketers. So I built the bridge, upload your zoom, call, walk away, come back to 6 weeks of content, fair warning. I only take 10 clients per month. not fake scarcity, real bandwidth limits. Each client gets custom prompts personal refinement sessions, and my decade of experience baked into their system. That takes time. I refuse to dilute the quality. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out. We do a content. DNA session, not a sales call. I build your custom system during our call. You watch your own words become 30 pieces of content. You decide. If you want this power permanently. the session alone will change. How you think about content forever. You have 2 choices. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep falling behind. Keep watching others dominate your space. or let your conversations become your content. Empire DM me with, done with manual right now I'll send you examples of what bidden Atlas created from a single 37 min call your next zoom call is either tomorrow's content or tomorrow's regret. You decide Francis Ps. Still manually creating content in 2024. That's like handwriting, hand washing clothes when you own a washing machine, except the washing machine, also folds organized and delivers everything to your closet while you sleep. Alright. Alright! Alright! You know, as far as the Sas goes, and don't think that was too over the top, like. I don't think anything in there was really going to like turn someone off or piss them off. so I'm not sure how I feel about that. We'll see what version? 2 firm but fair level 5 to 6 sounds like. And then once I'm done reading this. We'll go back and talk about how I'd kind of critique and edit from here, because, like, I don't, these are not production ready yet. And and we want to get through these. And because right now, what I'm trying to do is show you that AI can write some pretty good content like this. It's still going to always sound a little bit off, because, like it's not quite your own words. But, as you can see. I'm putting a lot of my own stuff in here. And as I've been kind of like talking through this I've told them, like little bits about me and that's where it knows, what I say, oh, I talked about this. In there. Well, actually, I said, those vite I, mentioned the the right viral posts, like social media scheduling tools. This they came out with this on its own like that was pretty good stuff. But this is definitely much more in line in line with me although not quite there yet. Version 2 firm but fair level 5 and 6. Stop creating content. Wait, hear me out, let your conversations do instead. Last week bit analyzed my coaching calls, and discovered something that completely changed. How I think about content. Bit bit's my AI co-pilot. Atlas is the one who does the heavy lifting they're about to become your favorite team. Here's what we found. The average coach is 5 to 10 conversations per week that could become 200 plus pieces of content. Instead, those conversations disappear into the zoom cloud while you stress about what to post tomorrow. Sound familiar. I get it. I really do. For 10 years I've been the behind the scenes writer creating content systems for coaches, 10 million words written 10 million plus in revenue generated and hundreds of campaigns launched. and you know what killed me. watching brilliant coaches struggle with content while mediocre ones dominate the space, the difference systems. Here's the uncomfortable truth. your best content already exists. It's in your coaching, calls, your strategy sessions, your masterclasses, your workshops. Every single conversation contains complete story arcs that would make Andre chaperone, proud, quotable insights. Your audience desperately needs teaching frameworks. You don't even realize you're sharing email sequences, hiding your explanations. Social posts scattered throughout your sentences within 1 h of ending your zoom call. All this could be extracted, formatted, and ready to post. But AI content sucks. You're absolutely right, those generic right viral post tools. They're why, everyone sounds the same. It's exactly why I built something different. And here's how this actually works. Instead of templates, you get custom prompts built specifically for your voice. You start with a content DNA session, where I learn your unique frameworks, your communication style, your brand personality, your audience's languages. Then build custom, brand kits, design kits and prompts. Capture your essence, not generic. AI, slop your actual voice, automate, and here's the kicker every one to 2 weeks. We were fine together, and I know, like, I'm really not liking this very much. But I'm reading this all the way through for 2 reasons. One, it's super important to read your copy out loud, to hear how it sounds, but also to like there might be like one or 2 nuggets in here that I really like that I can use. Right? I I like this part. you know, this is, this is decent, like, we can do something with this. But like, for the most part, I'm just not. Yeah. I like the 10 better. Not generic. AI slop. Your actual voice automated. Here's the kicker everyone fine together because your voice evolves, your message sharpens your system. Should, too. This one. This is good math is simple. We did that. Why I built this. I spent years managing content teams for coaches. I hate it managing people, coordinating schedules, chasing deadlines. It was everything I didn't want to do. I just wanted to create great content. That converts. I built a system that came up. Excuse me. So I built a system that could handle 89% of the heavy lifting. Now, one person can manage what used to take a team and coaches can focus on coaching instead of content. Creation. Here's the thing. The coaches succeeding right now are better than you. They just show up more consistently while you're playing content. They're posting content while you're finding your voice. They're amplifying theirs while you're learning canva. They're closing clients. The gap isn't talent. It's systems. I can only take 10 new clients this month. This isn't fake scarcity. It's real bandwidth. Each client gets custom prompt, developed, personal onboarding, bi-weekly refinement sessions by decade of experience. Quality takes time or is refuse to compromise on that what happens next? You reach out with ready for systems. We schedule a content DNA system. I build your custom system during the call, no pressure sales zeros, right? So I'm just gonna skip the rest of that because kind of yeah, I just I like, I like the Sas version better for sure but still not quite there yet. So we're just going to go from here right? So like this part. I feel it's less funny than when I read it the 1st time. I think that's because it's trying to jam it together. So like the 1st thing I'm gonna do is copy this. I don't really like that section as much as I did in your rubric or grading. I feel like it kind of falls a little bit flat when you scrunch it all together. I think having something earlier on about cosplaying as a Va. While your competitors are running system. Well, I don't like the competitors. Running systems part. The cosplaying Va is really good. And then, later on, you had something about oh. the intern thing, and I forgot where it was. But, like I I like that, I think, combining those together early on could be a nice little comedic relief and humorous bit to get into the content right away and pull people in. So what if we drop the every manual post you create as a choice to say small and like. Try to use that somewhere later in the post and focus this once, like on the cause playing with like the Va intern stuff, because I think that could be a lot funnier. Oh, oh. shoot so I didn't have like the text box. Oh, it's control command. B. There we go alright. And then so this is all I'm gonna do. As I go through here is just say like what I like and don't, and how I want to finish it. I'm not gonna pause and actually go through this like and talk you guys so you can hear how I like go through this and think about this rather than just do, and then be like, Oh, here, here's the output. Because that's not helpful. I'm not really liking the integration of bit and atlas into this right it it seems a bit jarring and confusing of like, Who's this bit person analyzing the coaching calls? And who's this Atlas person structuring together? So I think maybe we should just drop that all together for this and just not use the characters at all. What else I do like the stern at Canva 11 pm. Reference. That's pretty solid. I also really like the think about it. Section the Monday, Tuesday, fri. Through Friday, like those those really good I think we should keep those and then oh, here we there's the larping as your own intern. I think that's really good to alright. I didn't mean to say that in there I just got excited when I found it all right. Should keep those The. Here's what's actually insane. Part is pretty solid, too. We can keep that again like dropping the bitten Atlas can extract all that I think it would be beneficial to just say something along the lines of as soon as your zoom call is done processing you know we leverage AI and automations to analyze the transcript for the best moments, using code. Something like that, you know. We turn that long form into clips right away and then iterate over each clip to create. I don't know. Post something like that. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for there, but I do like the idea of like the the AI, you know, bit. Does this Atlas does that? You go have lunch? But again dropping like bit and atlas, and just having some sort of like AI is doing this thing while you're off living your life and right. And that's 1 thing that I really kind of like want to touch on what I think is so exciting about AI, and everybody is like freaked out like AI is gonna take our jobs like, yes, good, please, please, like I don't. The more AI can do this. The more that I can like help. Other people like create better content for themselves right? Because, like writing good content. like, actually, right as a human like takes time, takes energy, lots of brain power and stuff like that. And it's also difficult, because, like, I don't actually know what my clients thinking, like, all I can go on is the conversations I've had and the things that they've shared with me, and I might have not asked the right questions like I do a pretty good job, and I try my best and things like that. But I don't always ask the right things. But if it's you writing the content for yourself, having a conversation with an AI, you know that that thing will spark or like. It'll ask a question like, Oh, that story right? Which might might not have been a story that you even thought about before. So there's a lot of benefits to being able to like. Do all this more yourself. And the AI is making that happen right like, especially in the copywriting. Field content creation field. It's taking those jobs. And it's going to keep taking people's jobs. And it's going to be starting with like those mundane move, data from one software to another. this, that and the other thing copy paste kind of stuff like a lot of Admin tasks. Things like that are going to be eaten up really quickly. and we're going to be freed up to do like cooler, better things, right like, instead of thinking like, Oh, my God, you know, executive assistant like you're gonna fire them because of AI. It's like, no like they're going to. Now have an AI tool that has all of your conversations that you've been having with clients, them team, whatever that they can infinitely query to help them come up with plans, ideas, executions for the stuff that you want to happen right? So it's going to give them more power to do their job faster and better like. That's what we're getting into. So back to it. Ai content is garbage right? Those red error. I really like the pull on. I really like the viral post tool section that's really good. I think. kind of putting ourselves against those works really well, because there are like dozens of right viral content software out there. But the they pump out the same regurgitated Linkedin inspiration poem that makes everyone sound like a motivational poster had a baby with a fortune. Cookie is absolutely fire. I love that I like and want to have more lines like that throughout the content. Let's see. Alright. So let's see this next part here. Oh. so I like this start of the here's what separates this from every other. AI content scam section. But what I do want to kind of get into a little bit more of like what it is, what they're getting kind of thing, because it's not quite accurate right now. What? Oh, what? So what this is more about is like, we're gonna have the content DNA call. And that's designed to get the custom brand Kit design Kit. And then Meta prompt so they can create their own content. But that's more of like a free lead magnet kind of thing, like a way to give value 1st and like show proof, this works. We're not building their system or anything on the call. They're not getting anything like done on the caller like that point of this is to get them the prompts that they can use and start putting it like chat to your cloud right now and create content, but also to like. I am going to give them some clips and some example posts created by the system, just to show them like what's possible. Using this system. And you know, I do like the the one part of like you get to decide if this is something you want permanently, right? So like, basically, what we're gonna be doing is going over their business, who they are, what they're doing, what their offer is stuff like that to build out the brand and design Kit, I'm going to turn that call into a few clips for them for examples, and then go over that with them, and then, at the very least. They're going to have the brand Kit design Kit and the Meta prompt that they can use with just like a regular chat Gpt or Claude session and make whatever kind of content that they want manually that way. And it's just something. If they want help with the automation part of it, then we can talk about using my system. Let's see anything else. I really do like the section under the coaches who get ahead. Get this already ahead, like while you're finding your voice while you're playing content while you're building consistency. I like those. those are really solid. I do want you to drop the thing like truth. Bomb fair warning. That's a little bit like, too, on the nose for me. I'm much bigger fan of the 2 plus 2, and let them figure out it's 4 method, right? that's where it goes in the show and not tell like no one likes being told. But we do want to tell them and give them kind of the right ingredients for them to come to the conclusion that we want type of thing. Oh, my God! Need to remember to keep that on there. Okay, what else? Oh. I don't want to mention anything about like come back to 6 weeks of content like, I don't want to put the week thing in there, simply because, like a who are we to decide like how much content someone posts. And then the other thing, too, is like depending on how we set up these prompts. It might only be a day or 2 days, or a couple days worth of content. It just might be that we have custom stuff for each platform, like really kind of depends on the client and how much content they want to put out. Like, for example, I plan to do long form videos, multiple times a week and create a bunch of clips and content from that. And you know, ideally, you know, post a ton of clips from each of those where, like one of those videos might be like 2 or 3 days worth of content, only type of thing. So I don't want to say 6 weeks worth of content, because then that also seems like overwhelming. It's like, oh, well, then, what do I? What do I need this for? Like I'm just gonna like, fill up with so much content, so quickly like, so again, this is more for giving them like a bunch of content. That they can put out everywhere and just make sure that they're getting exposure, because, like the one thing that we can know for certain is that if you put out more content, more people are going to see your content right if if every video you get gets 200 views and you put out one video a day, that's 200 views. But if you put out 5 videos a day that now becomes a thousand views right? And you can easily just start to multiply the views you get by putting out more content. Even if you're not necessarily growing right away, because there is like a certain amount of consistency and timing that you need to like. put on these platforms to build up an audience didn't mean to send in that last part. That was kind of just the conversation to that's supposed to be for us, but we'll see what we'll see what it does with that. Here's exactly what happens. You reach out here 2 choices. I'm not too happy with the ending with, like the 2 choices. Type of thing. It it falls a little flat. 1st off like I'm not. Gonna send them a example of another call like that seems pointless like when we're gonna do like a call together. And they're gonna have like specific content for them. Right? Like, why would I want to see a generic example of someone else. When I can get one. That's for me. Right? So let's drop that part. Also, it's 2025, not 2024. I like the the hand washing clothes, analogy type thing. And then how you also do like folds, organizes, delivers. Could we find a different but similar analogy that might be like a little bit more ridiculous and funny. So we end it kind of on like a fun. Humorous note. You know just anything that just kind of makes a little bit more like ridiculous and extreme pretzels. Oh. alright! We'll see what we get there. And then last thing. and to be clear, these were all suggestions and edits for the level. 10 Sas. Post. I like that a lot better than the level 5 to 6 1. i thought the 5 to 6 1 was actually just like pretty flat and overall. Just not very inspiring up in that. Sas is definitely better. I was actually impressed or not impressed. I was surprised that it wasn't more sas, I guess, but worked out pretty well. I think we could like up up the Sas just a hair with a few more of those funny one-liners like I mentioned, but overall very good with that. and I would say, just like, Let's drop the second one and just kind of fell flat like I said, I don't think we need to really like. Do anything more with it. we'll just drop it for now and work on the 1st post. All right. Didn't mean to hit. Enter. Yeah, I want to put one more thing. Let's stop that minutes. It's so before I start speaking with the intro here. I do always like giving some kind of like starting with either encouragement, reinforcement, or kind of critiques right away, just to like. Let the AI know like where I stand on the content. You know I might say like this is not anything that I was looking for. I don't like any of this blah blah, or I might say like, Oh, my God, this is great, this fantastic start! Here's some edits I want to make stuff like that. I think that just does a good job like helping to prime the AI and knowing like is this, you know, like. is this going in a minor edits way, or like we go and rewrite right like there, there is something, and we'll get into that more. But there is like something about like activating different parts of their memory. This is a really good start. I like a lot of the edits and updates that we made. So far, I think we have just a little bit more to go. And I've put my suggestions, notes, ideas below here. I need you to analyze those and then rewrite and update the 1st version. Make it more in line with what I'm talking about, and just generally better. I really need to like find a better way to say like, Make it better, because, like. what does better mean? Right? So maybe actually, what we'll do. let's see, make it more aligned with my talk about, and at least 10% better. Then the current version and try that. And then we always want to go back down to the end and just do kind of a quick context, synopsis summary, and like one more time, like what we want to after analyzing your post above and all the additional contacts I've given you, I need you to rewrite the Facebook post. So it's more in line with what I said above. I want it to be a little bit funnier, too, and then also just ensure that it's 10% better and more interesting engaging for our coaching audience. Alright, let's see what happens there. And as it's chat as it's thinking and doing its thing. you know, I gotta wrap this up here because I've got another call. I have to run off to. But I think this is a great start with kind of showing like what you can do. both with just like the difference of how. And I think the main thing that like I want to show is like the difference between just like throwing in a prompt here and seeing what you get versus having one of these projects with a prompt already built into it. And mind you like, what we'll be doing in the next video is actually going over the brand kit and probably this specific prompt and refine it more right? Because it's like. well, let's see what. Let's see what happens. Let's see what we got with this rewritten version. Maximum. Wake up energy. Let me get hydrated first.st Stop creating content. Seriously. Stop! Let your conversation do instead, because right now your cosplay is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that make content in their sleep. Yes, Karen, from your mastermind, the one who suddenly posts everywhere. She's not working hard. She just stopped playing intern. Last Tuesday I analyzed my coaching call recordings and discovered something that made me quit creating content forever. I mean, manually the robots handle it. Now. here's what I found. You're performing the same brilliant conversation 5 times a week, creating exactly 0 content from it. Then staring at canva at 11 pm. Trying to remember if you used Montserrat or railway last time. This is insane behavior. Think about Monday strategy session, where you drop pure gold. Tuesday group coaching masterclass everyone loved vanished. Wednesday. Sales. Call where you explain your entire methodology. Gone. Thursday workshop, where 3 people cried from breakthroughs, poof! Friday. Interview where you finally nailed your origin. Story, dust, 300 min of certified genius, 0 content created but sure spend money. Saturday bashing, content, translation, panic, Korean mediocre post where your coffee gets cold and your family wonders if you still live there. Here's what's actually insane. You already have the content. You're just too busy creating, content to notice every single zoom call contains 12 to 15. Complete story arcs. The kind Andre chaperone charges 10 KA month to map out. I forgot to take this out like no one cares like if anybody even knows who's Andre Chaperon is like, I'd be surprised like he's very much more of a lifestyle business guy. But he's absolutely one of my favorite marking writers. So like. yeah, I forgot to mention that you know what we're just gonna go back and do that really quick. See, this is where I talk about like I will go back and redo this when I don't like something, or if I forgot something, and it really here, we'll put it here, because that's right around the same spot. Don't mention Andre chaperone, or really like any of the creators in my brand kit. Those aren't something to be explicitly referenced or said publicly. I gave those in the brand kit so that you have a better understanding of who I like to create content like or other creators that, like I enjoy their content, think they're good writers, things like that, and would be excited if someone thought my content was similar to theirs. So it's more so a design style thing, than anything that you should ever, ever, ever mention their name like I never want to see like their names come up unless it's something that like I've explicitly referenced that you're transforming, but never introduce their name on your own. Okay. alright. So we'll drop that back in there and give it a second to rewrite and again, like, that's, I think, a really important thing, too, is like, if you see some of those little errors as you go go back and redo this. It's gonna save you a lot as far as like context and conversations goes, because, like Claude has a limit. Chatgp doesn't really anymore. Now that it has the memory feature built in like. I haven't reached a conversation limit, but there are very real conversational limits with Claude now. So if you kind of go back and tweak this a bit. It also gives you a better starting spot right like from here. I would probably go back and keep redoing this and keep editing this until I get closer to what I wanted to the point of even like, maybe I would take this section out, or I'd re explain that section. So let's see what it said. Now stop creating content seriously. Stop, let your conversations do instead, because right now your cosplan is your own unpaid intern, while your competitors are running systems that work while you sleep. Yes, you, the one who just opened canva in another tab. Close it. Here's what I discovered last Tuesday. So, you know, I'm still not super happy with this opening, and I don't think we're going to quite get there in this session, and that's what we're going to. I guess this is what I'll kind of leave you off with, and a little tease here is like the next thing that we're going to do in the next video is, I'm going to redo my brand kit. And I think we'll actually work on a structured prompts right? Like I have have this social post, right? We should probably have. Actually, you know, I'm gonna do this really quick. No, I'm not because I don't necessarily like this like this is just kind of like a placeholder to to get stuff going. So what will come back in this next video is restructuring this prompt and then kind of going back through the same similar exercise and showing like how to do it like. Quote unquote the right way, right like I. I would put this like the good wrong way, like, if you don't have your own Meta prompts create or structured prompts created where you can kind of consistently put. create content, a certain output. This would be the way that you really should be having a conversation with the ais like you start with something right. You have to give it some sort of draft piece finished piece, whatever it might be, the better that you can give it in the beginning. the better. The conversation is gonna go. But, like, you know, if you don't have a lot of marketing or copyright experience like that's fine, right, give it something and then work with it from there to improve it. And you know you can start with just saying like, Hey, first, st I need to create a rubric to make this better oops. and then from there it'll give you a bunch of ideas and things like that. If you need more suggestions, ask for more suggestions. You just go back and have this back and forth conversation until you get the way you want. And is there a pain? Kind of yeah. But what I'll show you in the next video is like how you can either a take that like a, you know, like we originally did in this one right? And it creates a prompt for it for this rubric, and you can go back in and then refine the prompt to be like exactly what you're looking for and then work with it from there, and kind of restart the conversation type of thing right? Because, like, if I went, I took this prompt actually, let's see what happens when I do take this prompt alright. Let's just see while I kind of blab on a little bit. So now this is actually taking that rubric that we gave, and it's going to edit it based on that right. And I'll probably come up with something like even better than what we had before, and you just kind of keep working out from there. And then, once you have that prompt d plus it got it went up a little bit interesting. But once you have that kind of base prompt, you can start to work with it and use it, and that's what we'll be doing in the next video is, I will actually be kind of going through of like creating a very structured prompt with, Hey, how to create a good lead, how to create a good hook, what goes in the body, and like more and more and more details about that. So I'm not having this kind of like back and forth where? You know, to be perfectly honest like that last those last couple of versions that it's not done. Those last couple versions that we saw. I'm like these are better. But again, like the hook lead is still just not quite there. So that's something that we can work on and fix with a really good, detailed, prompt. And that's what I'm going to be covering the next video here and now, just to end this out like, let's just take a look at what the difference is with putting in that much more explicit, prompt about with, like the actual rubric in there, generic opening 0 pattern interrupt right? Like. So it's saying a lot of similar things, you know, obviously, that we would think but is getting more insight into why, it's yes or no right complete voice mismatch. This reads like every Guru sales page, not pragmatic text, heavy blah, blah 0 brand characters where it's Atlas, where it's bit right? So like it's pretty similar to like what we've gone through already. But it gives more context, which would be super super helpful if you are someone who's newer to marketing, and you're just not entirely sure like why, this would be like good or bad. That opening is deader than Disco. The fake empathy is nauseating. You buried your actual differentiator. Your brand has 10 years experience, see? See? So like, that's that's a really interesting point that like hasn't been brought up yet. that it's saying that the actual differentiator is that experience. And like, where is any of that you know credibility. We get the trust me, Bro. Energy, right? So like this would be like, Hey, like, let's just make sure that we get that like higher up. You know, if you follow Alex from Osel with the proof promise plan, you know, starting out with a proof like 10 years experience 10 million dollars. 10 million words that kind of thing. let's see what it says for new. See? Like, look, look we didn't get this hook before, after writing 10 million words and building 500 plus automation flows. I've discovered the 7 min prompt chain that turns any zoom call into 30 pieces of content. So like it's not quite what I would use, just simply because, like, it's not totally accurate. But this much better hook than the last one. Right. I like it more than the stop creating content, and whatever else character driven story Atlas here last Tuesday had been analyzed. No right like we. Just my character's wrong. So we're just gonna have to drop the character stuff. Contrarian challenge. Your content. Strategy is backwards. Stop creating. Start capturing. Here's the na and M. Workflow that changed everything. Right? So if I want to go more of a technical route, maybe if I was going after like automation people and saying like, Hey, like I have a like a done for you, product that like you can sell and use and modify yourself like I might go that angle with that you know. But again the the, the prompt itself. kind of lacks a bit of understand like who my actual audience is, and simply because I just haven't updated updated with like, who I'm going after. Now, I've been kind of in a audience finding as I built this out. driving gold, sharing insights. I like that. I like that right? So like overall like I'm I'm enjoying these suggestions much better. And a cta that doesn't suck instead of drop a try. Curious how bit analyzes your calls. Watch them, dissect a real coaching session, extract 31 content pieces in 7 min. Link and comments. No email required like, I like this call to action a lot better again, if we just drop the character part of it. You know the linking comments. No email required. Basically, it's just saying, like, Hey, like, you want to see a demo of the system like you'll be able to watch. Send a comment. Just watch it. You don't have to do it. So right, this kind of inspires me of like, okay, like, maybe that's something I'll need to do as part of some of these posts is like, have that kind of follow on piece, and whether it's I don't know. Maybe it's just post, you know, like posting the full video like this to Youtube in the comments. So like, Hey, if you want to go deeper, check it out. So yeah, I'm gonna cut this here. I'm pretty sure we've gone on for longer than I thought. But I'm pretty pretty happy with how this how what we've gone through so far. And then I think the next thing that we'll do tomorrow is actually start to Start with the brand kit and the design Kit, I think it's really important to go into those. There's a few things I've learned since then that I'd like to Update and create like, I said, like I created these as like the minimum viable, prompt that I can have for all this stuff to like. Just get something that's generally correct like I said, like, I don't necessarily like a lot of this, but it was more for proof of concept, for the system to get something out there. And now what I'm going to be doing over the next few days is refining all this stuff and really putting some more thought and effort into it and getting getting this really down to the point where it's actually creating like content that I really really like. Because I know AI can do it. I've done it. I produced it. you know. A lot of it's just like in here, with some more back and forth, but with what I've really been learning the last couple months. I know that we can do this in the single shot with it here. So stay tuned for the next video where we're going to actually be diving into how to update and change some of these prompts so that they create better content and help AI create content that doesn't suck. Thanks for watching if you made it. This far, really enjoyed talking about this stuff and can't wait to talk more about it.\n\n{/Transcript}\n"
