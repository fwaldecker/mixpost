Perfect, thank you. I’ll begin researching a full-stack plan to build a self-hosted video clipping and repurposing tool that supports user-prompted AI, transcript-based editing, multi-source video ingestion, and a lightweight video editor UI. I’ll also identify relevant open-source frameworks and APIs (like Riverside.fm, Opus Clip, FFmpeg, etc.) that you can build on.

I’ll report back with a proposed architecture, tooling stack, and implementation roadmap shortly.


# Plan for a Self-Hosted AI Video Clipping & Editing Platform

## Overview and Objectives

We are aiming to build a self-hosted video content repurposing platform similar to **Opus Clip** and **Riverside.fm**, with key enhancements tailored to our needs. The platform will ingest long-form videos (from Zoom recordings, live streams, etc.), automatically identify “gold nugget” moments using AI, and turn them into shareable short clips – much like OpusClip does with its AI “clipping” model. However, unlike OpusClip’s fully-automatic approach, our solution will empower users to **customize the AI’s focus via prompts**. In other words, users can guide the AI on what themes or highlights to extract by updating their own prompts, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all model. OpusClip itself recently introduced a “ClipAnything” feature where you *“just type your prompt… We will clip the right moments for you from any video”* – our platform will embrace this concept, giving users full control over the AI’s clipping criteria.

Another major goal is to support **multiple video sources and higher-quality inputs**. We plan to ingest separate video tracks for active speakers, screen shares, and possibly multiple participants, rather than a single mixed recording. This mirrors how professional recordings (or services like Riverside) produce separate tracks for each participant and the screen. By pulling video directly from sources like Zoom (via API) or recording locally, we can avoid quality loss from screen captures and achieve a polished final output. Eventually, we’ll even add our own built-in recording function (similar to Riverside.fm’s studios) so users can record sessions with multiple participants directly in our app – but with the crucial difference that our recordings will be programmatically accessible (via API or direct download), something Riverside does not offer to external developers.

In summary, **the platform’s distinguishing features** will be:

* **User-Guided AI Clipping:** Users can provide or update text prompts to steer the AI on which moments or topics to highlight (e.g. “clip the part where speaker explains ROI of marketing”). The system will analyze transcripts and find matching high-value segments.
* **Multi-Source HD Video Ingestion:** Ability to connect to sources like Zoom cloud recordings, YouTube/OBS streams, or local files, and ingest multiple synchronized video tracks (speaker cams, screen shares, etc.) for compositing in higher quality.
* **Integrated Simple Video Editor:** A web-based editing interface for fine-tuning the clips – allowing repositioning and resizing of video frames (to format for vertical or other aspect ratios), timeline trimming by dragging start/end, and even text-based editing (delete words from transcript to cut those parts of video, akin to Descript).
* **AI Content Generation:** For each clip produced, optionally generate accompanying social media text (captions, summaries, or blog-style posts) and even an image asset (e.g. a thumbnail or illustrative graphic) based on user prompts – turning each clip into a multi-content “package”.
* **Social Media Scheduling Integration:** Seamless hand-off to a scheduling tool (a modified version of Mixpost) to queue up the clips and their captions for posting across platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.) on a schedule. This closes the loop from raw video to published social content.
* **Self-Hosted & Extensible:** The system will be deployable on our own servers and, in the long run, installable on clients’ servers. We’ll maintain control over data (no dependency on third-party SaaS), and offer white-label or customizable workflows for agencies. The architecture should be modular so features like the AI clipping, editor, or scheduler can be improved or replaced independently.

## Research on Existing Solutions

Before designing the system, it’s useful to examine existing products and frameworks that tackle parts of this problem:

* **OpusClip (opus.pro)** – A leading AI video repurposing tool that automatically turns long videos into short “viral” clips. OpusClip uses *“sophisticated AI to analyze and pick the gold nuggets”* from a video and *“seamlessly rearrange them into viral short clips”*. Under the hood, it uses big-data analysis of content and social trends, and an AI (ChatGPT-based) curation system to select highlights. Notably, OpusClip’s AI doesn’t just take one continuous chunk – it can identify key moments from **different parts** of the video and **combine** them into one coherent clip. It also auto-formats clips for social media: adding animated captions with highlighted keywords and cropping the video with the speaker kept centered in frame. These “smart touches” (inspired by popular editors like those used by Alex Hormozi’s team) make the output immediately engaging. However, OpusClip is a closed system – users upload a video and get clips with minimal manual control. The new *ClipAnything* feature does allow some prompt input, but generally users cannot fine-tune beyond choosing which suggested clips to download. **Our take-away:** We want to replicate OpusClip’s AI highlight detection (using transcripts and possibly multimodal cues), but **give users more control** (via prompt customization and editing tools). Also, we aim to support multi-track inputs (whereas OpusClip expects one video input).

* **Riverside.fm** – A remote recording platform that has recently added text-based editing and AI clipping features. Riverside’s core offering is high-quality **local recordings** of each participant: *“records audio and video locally on each participant’s device”* in up to 4K, and *“progressively uploads each participant’s local recording to the cloud”* for backup. This yields separate tracks (multitrack) that remain in sync and aren’t affected by network issues. Riverside then provides a web studio where you can edit. They introduced **Magic Clips** – an AI that *“turns the most important bits of your recording into shareable clips”* – and **text-based editing** where *“editing your recording is as simple as deleting text in your transcript”*. In essence, Riverside is combining Descript-like functionality (transcript-driven editing) with their recording platform. Users can record an interview, then automatically get suggested highlight clips (likely using a similar approach to OpusClip under the hood) and refine those clips by deleting transcript text or using the timeline. However, Riverside is a hosted service without an open API for exporting clips programmatically – you must manually download from their interface. **Our take-away:** The features of local multitrack recording, Magic Clips, and text-based editing confirm the **feasibility and demand** for what we plan. We will implement equivalent capabilities: per-participant recordings (in future), an **AI highlight finder**, and transcript-linked editing. But we’ll ensure everything is accessible via our own UI *and* programmatic means (so agencies can integrate it into their workflows). We’ll also cater to live sources like Zoom, whereas Riverside requires using their own recording tool.

* **Descript** – While not open-source, Descript pioneered **text-based audio/video editing**. Users get an automatic transcript for their media, then can cut or modify the media by editing the text document. This is something we aim to emulate (on a simpler scale) in our editor. In fact, Riverside.fm’s text edit feature is directly comparable to Descript’s functionality. For our implementation, we will rely on obtaining an accurate transcript and aligning it to the video timeline, so that when a user deletes a sentence or word, we know the exact time span to cut out. There are open-source tools to help with this (for example, **autoEdit** by OpenNews, which introduced a “paper-editing” workflow to cut video by text edits). We’ll leverage such approaches to build a lightweight text-based edit interface.

* **Other AI Clip Tools:** There’s an emerging ecosystem of AI clipping products (mostly SaaS) like **Vidyo.ai (QusO)**, **Klap**, **Vizard.ai**, etc., which all take long videos and spit out short clips. These mostly work similarly to OpusClip – using AI to detect highlights and reformat for social media. They confirm the viability of using transcripts and AI to automate clip creation, but none are open-source. We did find one notable open project: **FunClip** by Alibaba, an open-source automated video clipping tool. FunClip performs speech-to-text (with Alibaba’s ASR models) and lets the user **select text segments or speakers to clip**, outputting the corresponding video segments. It even integrates an LLM for “smart clipping”: after transcription, you can input a prompt or use default prompts, and FunClip’s LLM module will analyze the subtitles to suggest timestamp segments for clips. In other words, FunClip already does locally what OpusClip does in the cloud – it uses a transcript + LLM to find highlight timestamps. It supports *“multi-segment editing”* (selecting multiple quote segments to export) and automatically produces subtitle files for the clips. The UI is based on Gradio (so, a simple web UI). **Our take-away:** FunClip proves that our core idea can be implemented with open-source components. We can study or even reuse parts of FunClip – e.g. use its transcription and timestamp alignment approach, or the LLM prompt strategy for clip selection. (FunClip supports user-provided prompts for the LLM, which aligns perfectly with our “users update their own prompts” goal.) It’s a Python-based tool and even provides speaker diarization, which could help in multi-speaker scenarios. We might not use FunClip’s exact code, but it gives us a blueprint for combining ASR, NLP, and clipping.

* **Mixpost** – This is the open-source social media scheduling platform we plan to integrate for content distribution. Mixpost is a self-hosted tool (Laravel/PHP stack) that allows creating and scheduling posts to various social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.). By integrating with Mixpost (or an API thereof), we can programmatically create posts with our video clips and captions, and schedule them as needed. The benefit of using Mixpost is that it’s open-source and self-hosted, aligning with our deployment model (no reliance on external SaaS like Buffer or Hootsuite). We may use a *modified version* of Mixpost – likely to streamline the process of taking a clip (plus its auto-generated title/description) and scheduling it to multiple platforms at optimal times. Mixpost’s open nature means we can customize the UI or hooks to create a smooth “export to social media calendar” step from within our app.

* **Open-Source Video Editors:** While we don’t need a full NLE (non-linear editor) in the browser, it’s worth noting there are mature open-source video editing frameworks like **Kdenlive (MLT)**, **Shotcut**, **OpenShot**, etc. These are desktop GUI apps and probably too heavy for integration, but the idea is to avoid reinventing the wheel for basics like timeline management, trimming, etc. For instance, Kdenlive and OpenShot have libraries for rendering videos given an edit decision list. However, for the MVP, using **FFmpeg** directly for video compositing might be simpler and more lightweight. We can script FFmpeg to do things like concatenate clips, crop/zoom, overlay text, etc., rather than embedding a full editor engine. In fact, our current prototype uses FFmpeg commands to compose the speaker and screenshare tracks. FFmpeg’s filter capabilities (like the `xstack` filter for mosaics) will be central to combining multiple inputs. Using filters like **vstack/hstack** we can stack videos vertically or horizontally, and with `overlay` or `xstack` we can position multiple video streams arbitrarily on a canvas. This means we can programmatically achieve picture-in-picture layouts, side-by-side, or any arrangement needed for mixing a screen share and a camera feed into one frame. We’ll just need to calculate the scaling and offsets based on the desired output resolution (e.g. a 9:16 vertical frame).

## Key System Components and Approach

Based on the above research, we can outline the main components of our system and the technical approach for each:

### 1. **Video Ingestion Module**

**Sources:** Initially, the system will accept uploaded video files (e.g. an .mp4 from a Zoom recording or an .mkv from OBS). But we also want direct integration with external services to streamline input: for example, connecting to a user’s Zoom account via API to fetch cloud recordings, or a YouTube Live archive via YouTube’s API. Zoom’s API allows listing and downloading cloud recordings for a user (with proper OAuth and scopes) – one can retrieve a recording’s download URL and programmatically fetch it. Many developers have done this to automate pulling Zoom recordings; for instance, using Zoom’s `GET /users/{userId}/recordings` endpoint and then downloading the file via the provided URL. We will build a connector where users can link their Zoom account (using Zoom’s OAuth app flow) and then select from their recent recordings to import into our system. Similarly, for Google Drive, we can integrate the Drive API so users can choose a video file from their cloud storage. For live stream sources (like a YouTube live or a Twitch stream recording), if the platform provides an API for past broadcasts or if the user provides the recording file, we handle it the same way as a file upload.

In the future, once our **internal recorder** is ready, the ingestion module will also interface with that. The internal recorder will function akin to Riverside’s studios: multiple participants connect (via browser, using WebRTC), and each one’s AV stream is captured. We’ll implement this using either a WebRTC library or an open-source video conferencing solution. One option is leveraging **Jitsi** or **Mediasoup** to get separate recorded tracks. However, to keep things simpler and more controlled, we might roll out a custom recording client: using the browser MediaRecorder API to record each participant’s stream locally and upload progressively (just like Riverside does with progressive upload). This way, even if someone’s connection blips, their local recording is intact and will sync once fully uploaded. We’ll need a signaling server and a coordination mechanism (like a “studio room” concept). This part is complex, so it likely comes in a later phase – for MVP we rely on existing recordings. Nonetheless, designing the system with multi-track in mind means our data model should handle multiple input files that are time-synchronized (e.g., a JSON manifest linking a “screen share video” and an “active speaker video” that were recorded simultaneously).

**Multi-Track Handling:** When multiple tracks are ingested, we will not immediately merge them; instead, we’ll keep them as separate synchronized layers. The editing/compositing engine (discussed later) will be responsible for merging them into the final frame. This preserves maximum quality and flexibility (e.g., one can choose layout after import). We will likely designate one track’s audio as primary (or possibly mix audio from all tracks if needed). If using Zoom recordings: Zoom can provide separate files for active speaker view and gallery or screen share, if set up accordingly. Users could upload both the screen recording and speaker recording to our system and mark them as simultaneous. Our system might assist by analyzing their timestamps to sync (or require they start at same timecode).

### 2. **Transcription Service**

Accurate transcripts are the backbone of AI-driven editing. We will integrate a transcription pipeline that can operate either via a third-party API or locally via open-source models. A strong candidate is **OpenAI’s Whisper**, an open-source ASR model known for high accuracy in multiple languages. Whisper can be run on our server (with GPU for speed) to generate a timestamped transcript (Word-level timestamps if using certain variants, or at least sentence/phrase-level time codes). The open-source FunClip tool uses Alibaba’s **Paraformer** ASR model – which is optimized for Chinese but also supports English – and gets timestamps with high accuracy. We could start with Whisper (since it’s well-documented and has no external dependencies beyond the model weights) and ensure we get a transcript in a convenient format (like SRT or VTT). The output transcript will include each word (or each line) with start and end times. We will store this in our database and also display it in the UI for the user.

If the video already has an existing transcript (for example, Zoom cloud recordings can come with an auto-generated transcript, or YouTube might have captions), we might allow using those to save processing time. But a custom transcription with a consistent model ensures uniform quality. We can provide a setting to choose language or to do speaker diarization. For speaker identification: since we plan multi-track input, we somewhat know who is speaking on each track, but if using a mixed recording, diarization (splitting transcript by speaker) could be useful. There are open libraries (like NVIDIA NeMo, or even FunClip’s integration of CAM++) that could attribute segments to speakers. This is a nice-to-have for making the transcripts more informative (labeling “Speaker A: … Speaker B: …”). Initially, we might not focus too heavily on diarization, as it complicates the pipeline – many use-cases like a single talking head video don’t need it.

**Output:** The transcription service will produce (a) a text transcript for AI analysis, and (b) a structured data (like an array of segments with text and timestamps) for editing. We’ll likely convert it to an **editable transcript format** such as an interactive text where each word or sentence is clickable (to highlight the corresponding moment in video). This will power the text-based editing later.

### 3. **AI Clip Selection (Highlight Detection)**

This is the core “magic” that replicates what OpusClip and others do. Once we have the full transcript, we need to decide which parts of the video would make compelling stand-alone clips. Our approach will involve Large Language Models (LLMs) and possibly some heuristics:

* **LLM-Based Summarization and Excerpting:** We can feed the transcript (or chunks of it, if very long) into an LLM (like GPT-4 or an open-source equivalent if we aim for local processing eventually) along with a user-provided prompt or set of instructions. The prompt can be along the lines of: *“Analyze the video transcript and identify X number of the most interesting or informative moments that could stand alone as a short clip. Focus on \${user\_prompt} when choosing highlights. For each candidate clip, provide the start and end timestamp and a short title or reason why it’s a highlight.”* The user’s custom prompt `${user_prompt}` might be something like *“the funniest moments”*, or *“when the speaker mentions marketing ROI or case studies”*, or *“key tutorial steps”*. This allows the user to steer what “interesting” means. OpusClip’s curation AI *“first understands the entire video, segments it into chapters, and then selects the most interesting or informative parts to create clips with viral potential”* – we will emulate this by instructing our LLM to act as a content curator. Because long transcripts may exceed token limits, we might use summarization or chaptering first. For example, have the LLM summarize each section of the transcript, then analyze summaries. Alternatively, use a smaller model or heuristic to break the video into topics (perhaps using embeddings or keyword frequency to detect topic changes), then have the LLM pick the best from each topic.

* **Prompt Template & User Input:** We will design default prompt templates that yield good results (perhaps by experimenting with known good highlight outputs). The user will be able to modify parts of this prompt. For instance, by default the prompt might ask for “the most insightful and exciting moments”. If the user instead wants humorous bits, they change the prompt to emphasize humor. The UI could present a few preset prompt styles (like “Find educational insights” vs “Find funny moments”) as well as a custom prompt field.

* **Sentiment/Audio/Visual Cues:** In addition to pure transcript text, a more advanced approach (likely post-MVP) is to incorporate **audio and visual cues** to detect excitement or importance – e.g. higher volume or pitch of the speaker (indicating excitement), audience laughter (if applicable), or on-screen changes (like slides switching). OpusClip hints that their *ClipAnything* model is “multimodal” using visual, audio, and sentiment cues. We can incorporate simple versions of this: e.g., if the video has segments where the speaker’s tone is energetic or the speech rate increases, those might correlate with high-emphasis points. Similarly, if there’s a slide deck, maybe transitions in the slide could mark important sections. Initially though, the transcript (with an LLM that “understands” context and sentiment from text) might suffice, especially if the user prompt gives direction. We will keep this extensible.

* **Output of AI Analysis:** The AI will output a set of candidate clips with timestamps. For example: *Clip1: 00:10–00:55 – “Introduction of the main concept”; Clip2: 05:20–06:00 – “A funny anecdote about X”*. We will take these and present them to the user for review. The user might see a list of 3-10 suggested clips (depending on length of source). Each suggestion can be previewed (we can play that segment in a mini-player) and the user can choose which to keep. The user can also **edit the suggestions** before finalizing – e.g. adjust the start/end time slightly if the AI’s cut is awkward, or edit the title/description. Because our users might want to generate *multiple formats of content* from each clip, we will also integrate **written content generation** here: For each clip, after selection, the user can prompt an AI (like GPT) to *“Write a Tweet-length summary”* or *“Draft a LinkedIn post elaborating on this clip”*, etc. This would be an optional step that yields text the user can further tweak. We might also generate an **image** if needed (for example, if posting to a blog, generate a header image via Stable Diffusion or use DALL-E via API given a prompt). These AI generations will be guided by user inputs as well (user can say “use a witty tone for the summary” or “generate an infographic-style image about the topic”). This essentially adds content repurposing beyond video – providing a whole content package per highlight.

It’s worth noting that an open-source tool like FunClip already supports *“LLM intelligent clip”* mode, where after transcription you *“click the 'LLM Inference' button”* and it *“automatically combines the video subtitles with preset prompts”*, then an *“AI Clip” button uses the LLM output to extract timestamps*. FunClip even suggests you can *“try changing the prompt to get the results you want”*. This is exactly the workflow we envision: the AI suggests clips, and the user can iteratively refine by adjusting the prompt. We can use FunClip’s approach as a guide. In fact, to implement this, we may incorporate a similar backend: e.g. run a local LLM (FunClip mentions integrating models from the Qwen series or GPT-series via API) – initially, we might use OpenAI’s API for convenience, but to keep it self-hosted, we will watch the development of open LLMs that could handle this with fine-tuning.

### 4. **Clip Editor & Compositor**

Once some candidate clip segments are chosen (either by AI or manually by the user selecting text), we move to the **editing interface**. This component has two main parts: **timeline trimming** and **video compositing/layout**.

**Timeline and Text-Based Editing:** For each clip segment (with start/end times on the source media), the user should be able to adjust the in/out points. We’ll provide a simple timeline view – likely a horizontal scrubber with handles that can be dragged to trim the start or end. We can also display the waveform or at least keyframes to help identify cut points (for future, we might generate a small “filmstrip” thumbnail sequence using ffmpeg to show frames). Additionally, we will display the transcript text for that segment. If the user sees some words in the middle they want to remove (for example, maybe the speaker goes “um actually let me rephrase that” – the user can cut that out by deleting the corresponding text in the transcript). When text is deleted, we will remove that portion from the clip. This is exactly what Descript and now Riverside do: *“delete a word from the transcript and have it disappear from the audio/video”*. Implementing this requires knowing the exact time span of that word or sentence – which we have from the transcription timings. So under the hood, a deletion would split the clip into two sub-clips around that excised portion and butt them together. We’ll need to ensure the join is not jarring – we might add a very short crossfade for audio or use a jump-cut that is acceptable for fast-paced social clips. The UI will likely reflow the transcript text with the cut section gone (we might show an ellipsis or a strikethrough on removed text for clarity).

We can maintain an edit decision list (EDL) data structure for each clip: initially one segment (start to end), and any cuts (text deletions or manual trims) create multiple included ranges. This EDL can later be turned into an ffmpeg concatenation command or processed by a video rendering library.

**Video Layout and Composition:** A big differentiator for us is handling multiple video tracks (e.g. speaker and screen) for each clip. Suppose the original recording had a screen share feed and a webcam feed; our user might want the final clip to show them picture-in-picture or a side-by-side view. For vertical (9:16) shorts, a common style is to show the screen content and the speaker’s face in a cropped manner. We will automate a default layout: for instance, the screen share could take the top part of the vertical frame and the speaker video could be scaled and placed at the bottom (or in a corner as an overlay). OpusClip mentions their AI *“ensures the speaker is always center in focus”* when cropping – we can use face detection or simply assume the speaker video is already a close-up and center them in the crop. But to start, a simpler approach: we know the aspect ratios of input videos (e.g., screen might be 16:9 landscape, speaker might be 16:9 or 9:16 if portrait webcam). For a vertical output, we might by default scale the screen video to full width of vertical (assuming vertical is 1080x1920 for example, width 1080). That screen content would then have some of its bottom part maybe cut off (since 16:9 scaled to 1080px wide yields 608px tall, leaving black above/below to reach 1920px total height). Instead, perhaps better to devote, say, top 3/4 of frame to screen, bottom 1/4 to speaker. We can programmatically do this with ffmpeg’s filters: use `scale` to resize each input appropriately, then use the `overlay` filter or `xstack` filter to place them. For example, using the **xstack filter** we can define a 2-row layout for vertical stacking of two videos (it can handle different heights if we pad appropriately). If we had exactly two inputs and want them one above the other, `vstack` with appropriate scaling could suffice (ensuring widths match). If dynamic placement is needed (like speaker video overlay small in a corner), `overlay` is the way: we’d scale the screen to full frame, then overlay the speaker on top at a certain position.

We want to give the **user control** to adjust this layout in the editor. So in the web UI, we’ll present a preview canvas (could be simply a `<div>` with background = screen video frame and an `<video>` or `<img>` element representing the speaker video over it, or use `<canvas>` to draw frames). The user can click and drag the speaker video to reposition it, and drag corners to resize (maintaining aspect). We can also allow cropping: e.g. maybe the user wants to zoom in on the speaker’s face – we could allow selecting a sub-region of the speaker video for the final frame (though this might be an advanced feature later). The main goal is that the user isn’t stuck with a rigid template; they can adjust the composition to ensure important content isn’t cut off.

Under the hood, when the user finalizes the position/size of each track, those parameters feed into our rendering pipeline. For instance, we determine: speaker video should be scaled to 300x300 and placed at (x=700,y=1400) on a 1080x1920 canvas; the screen video should be scaled to 1080x1440 and placed at (x=0,y=0). These numbers would form part of an ffmpeg filter-complex string like:

```
[screen]scale=1080:1440[bg];[speaker]scale=300:300[fg];[bg][fg]overlay=700:1400[out]
```

This is just an example – actual values depend on original resolutions. We will ensure to maintain aspect ratio and possibly add padding (black bars or blurred background) if needed.

We should mention also the ability to **reframe for different aspect ratios** easily. Perhaps not in MVP, but eventually, like OpusClip’s *“ReframeAnything”* that instantly makes a 16:9 video 9:16 while keeping speaker in frame. We might integrate a face-tracking auto-cropping for single videos later. For now, focusing on static repositioning is fine.

**Adding Text Overlays (Intro/Outro):** The user mentioned *“training on the front and back of the clips (add text by copying and pasting into the clip)”*. This suggests they often add an intro title or an outro call-to-action on their clips. We plan to have a simple way to do this: The editor could allow adding a **text overlay element** at the beginning or end of the clip. For example, an intro text that says “XYZ Podcast – Episode Highlights”. The user could type or paste any text, choose style options (font, color, maybe a simple preset template), and this text would appear for a few seconds at the clip start. Similarly for the end (e.g. “Follow for more!” or a URL). Implementing this can be done either by generating an image of the text or using ffmpeg’s `drawtext` filter during rendering. `drawtext` can take a TTF font and print text on video at specified time intervals. Another approach: have pre-made **templates** (like a branded intro card) that we overlay or prepend. But since user specifically says copy-paste text, we’ll likely implement an overlay text box in the UI.

So the editing interface will support adding **text boxes** and possibly simple shapes on the video canvas. This edges into “graphic design” territory, but a minimal version (just text) is achievable with HTML canvas or even using HTML/CSS positioned on top of the video in preview. We just need to translate that to the final rendering (which ffmpeg can do with drawtext if it’s not too complex, or we render a frame of that text as an image to overlay as a video for a few seconds).

**Preview vs Final Render:** It’s worth distinguishing that our web-based editor will show a **preview** of the composed clip, but the final output will be rendered server-side (to ensure high quality and sync). The preview could be done by actually using two HTML video elements (one for each track) synchronized in playback via JavaScript, which we then transform via CSS (for position/size) to mimic the composition. This way, the user can play the clip and see both videos in the arranged layout. Achieving frame-perfect sync might be tricky, but if both videos originated together, we can tie their playhead positions. Alternatively, we could generate a low-res proxy of the composition on the server whenever changes are made, but that might be laggy. A simpler approach: preview one track’s audio (say the speaker audio) and show both videos; slight A/V sync issues in preview might be tolerable as long as final output is correct.

When the user is satisfied, they hit “Export Clip” or similar. At that point, the backend will use ffmpeg (or potentially a headless video editing library) to produce the final clip file (MP4). We will ensure to use appropriate encoding settings for social media (H.264 codec, correct resolution, etc.). We might also incorporate **animated captions** like OpusClip does – but that might be a stretch goal. Animated captions (with emojis, highlighted words) require measuring word timings and rendering text dynamically – perhaps too advanced for MVP. Instead, we could at least hard-burn normal captions (subtitles) onto the video if desired, using the transcript. Or just provide the SRT sidecar and leave it to the user platform to auto-caption (TikTok etc. have caption options anyway).

### 5. **Content Generation (Text and Image)**

Parallel to video editing, we want to help users repurpose the clip into other content forms. After a clip is finalized, we will offer tools to:

* **Generate Written Posts:** Using the clip’s transcript and context, the user can prompt an AI to create accompanying text. For example: *“Write a 100-word LinkedIn post summarizing the point made in this clip.”* or *“Create a tweet thread of 3 tweets from this clip’s content.”* The model (GPT-4 or similar) will take the clip’s transcript (which is likely only 30-60 seconds long, so not too much text) and produce the content in the requested format. The user can edit this text in our UI afterward (to ensure it’s in their voice). We’ll need to integrate with an NLP API or local model for this. We should also be mindful of keeping the prompts and outputs consistent (maybe allow the user to set a tone or persona).

* **Generate an Image/Thumbnail:** Visuals increase engagement in social posts. We might incorporate a prompt-to-image generator (like Stable Diffusion if we have the infrastructure, or an API like DALL·E). The user can enter something like “an illustration of a person editing a podcast” or we can default to something relevant to the clip (maybe the AI can suggest: if the clip is about “marketing strategy”, generate a word cloud image of marketing terms, etc.). Another approach: capture a frame from the video itself as the thumbnail (like a frame where the speaker has a good expression), then optionally stylize it or add text. Initially, a simple feature could be *“Choose thumbnail”* – we show a few extracted key frames from the clip, and the user picks one, then can add text over it (like a title) for a thumbnail. Since this is somewhat peripheral, we can plan it as an extension after core features.

This content generation can be integrated into the workflow such that once the clip is rendered, the user is prompted: “Also want a caption or blog content from this clip?” They can skip or use it. It’s an **important value-add** especially for agencies who want to turn one video into many content pieces.

### 6. **Social Media Scheduling (Mixpost Integration)**

With clip videos and optional written content ready, the next step is publishing. We will tie in our (modified) Mixpost module here to allow scheduling posts. Mixpost supports multiple social accounts and provides a unified interface to schedule and publish content. The way we integrate could be:

* After a clip is finalized, user clicks “Share/Schedule”. This opens a scheduling UI (perhaps an embedded Mixpost interface or a simplified form if we use Mixpost’s API behind the scenes). They can select which platforms to post to (e.g. TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn, etc.), write or paste the caption text (we can auto-fill it with the AI-generated text, which they can modify per platform if needed), and choose a date/time for each or post immediately. Mixpost can handle posting videos to those platforms as long as it’s configured with the user’s accounts. We might have to extend Mixpost to support short-form video postings where applicable (it likely already supports media attachments for Twitter, Facebook, etc., but for TikTok/Instagram we need to verify API capabilities – there are official APIs for Instagram Reels and TikTok uploading now, which Mixpost might support or we can add).

* We’ll ensure the clip files are accessible to Mixpost. Since it’s self-hosted on the same server, we can simply give Mixpost the file path or URL to the video. We might even bypass creating a separate post in Mixpost’s DB by directly using its underlying libraries.

* Alternatively, if direct integration is complex, an MVP approach is to allow the user to download the clip and copy the generated text, then use their own social scheduler. But since the user explicitly mentioned Mixpost, we assume they want it built-in for a smooth automation (one-click from clip to scheduled post).

One possible flow: The user could create a batch of clips from a single long video (say 5 clips). Then in a scheduling view, they could assign each clip to a day of the coming week, with pre-filled captions. Mixpost can show a content calendar (as it does with monthly/weekly views). This would make the system extremely powerful: one long video becomes a week or month’s worth of social content ready to go, with minimal manual effort.

From a technical perspective, because Mixpost is open source, we can integrate at the database level or via an API. Mixpost likely has an API or at least we can create posts by writing to its DB. However, to keep things maintainable, using Mixpost’s own extension points or a small wrapper service that calls Mixpost’s internal functions might be best (this depends on Mixpost’s architecture, which is Laravel – we might consider having our app communicate with a running Mixpost instance via HTTP API if available).

### 7. **Architecture & Tech Stack Considerations**

Given the above components, here’s a proposed tech stack and architecture outline:

* **Backend Language:** We can use a combination of **Python** and **Node.js**. Python is great for the AI/ML tasks (transcription with Whisper, running LLM prompts, using libraries like moviepy/ffmpeg for rendering). In fact, open projects like FunClip are Python-based, which means we could leverage their code (they use Gradio for UI, but we’ll have our own UI). Node.js (or a framework like **Express / Next.js** if we want server-side rendering) could be used for the web server and API that the frontend interacts with, as well as handling integration with external APIs (Zoom, YouTube, etc.) because Node has plenty of packages for OAuth flows and HTTP APIs. Alternatively, we could stick to one backend language for simplicity. Since Mixpost is PHP (Laravel), integrating with it might be easier from a PHP side, but that would complicate our stack. A microservices approach might be clean:

  * A **Python service** for video processing (transcription, clip selection AI, rendering).
  * A **Web app** (could be Node/React or even Python Flask with templating, but likely React frontend + Node backend) for the UI and orchestrating tasks.
  * The Python processing service could be invoked via REST or a task queue (like Celery or RabbitMQ).
  * The reason to separate is to not block web requests during heavy processing. We might have an asynchronous job system: e.g., when user uploads a video, a job is queued to transcribe it; when they request final render, a job runs ffmpeg.

* **Frontend:** Likely a web application using **React** (or any modern JS framework). The UI has some complexity (timeline, draggable video overlays, text editing). Using libraries like **Redux** for state might help manage the transcript text vs video state. For the draggable resizing of video layers, simple HTML/CSS with absolute positioning and event handlers could suffice, or a library like interact.js for drag/resize might help. For the timeline, we might incorporate an existing timeline UI component if one exists, or use a simple range input slider for start/end trim if a full timeline is too much. We will also integrate a text editor for transcripts – possibly a custom component that displays text and allows selection; we can also consider using a contenteditable <div> where each word is an element with data-timestamp attribute, so when something is deleted we capture which span was removed. (There is prior art for this: autoEdit had a concept of a “paper transcript” where text is linked with timecode.)

* **Video Encoding/Processing:** **FFmpeg** will be our workhorse. We will ensure the server has FFmpeg installed with all necessary codecs. Python’s `ffmpeg-python` wrapper or simply shelling out to ffmpeg commands will be done to generate outputs. Also, we might use **MoviePy** (a Python library for video editing) for simpler tasks or for stitching clips, though it ultimately uses ffmpeg under the hood. Since we want to support potentially long input videos and multiple outputs, we should anticipate heavy processing – a machine with a good CPU/GPU is needed. For scaling to multiple users (like agencies hosting for clients), we may implement a queue and possibly allow multiple worker processes.

* **Data storage:** We’ll need to store video files (could be on disk or cloud storage if the server is not local). Given self-hosted nature, storing on the server’s disk is fine for now. Transcripts and metadata can be in a database (PostgreSQL or even just JSON files for MVP). We should also store the final clips, at least long enough to be posted or downloaded. If hosting for multiple clients, we’ll include user accounts and permissions.

* **Security & Privacy:** Since clients might upload sensitive raw footage, our self-hosted approach means the data stays on their servers if they deploy it, or on our controlled server in MVP. We should implement proper access control. Also, if we integrate external APIs (Zoom, etc.), handling tokens securely is important.

* **Open Source Libraries:** Summarizing some key open libraries we can utilize:

  * **Whisper** (OpenAI) – speech-to-text, multi-language.
  * **FunASR (Paraformer)** – alternative ASR from Alibaba if needed.
  * **FunClip** – as reference or for parts of implementation (they provide code for aligning transcript with video and selecting segments).
  * **PyTorch or TensorFlow** – if running ML models (for Whisper or any custom classifier).
  * **Transformers (HuggingFace)** – to call GPT or to use an open LLM.
  * **Gradio** – not for our final UI, but could be used in testing some ML components quickly.
  * **FFmpeg** – for all video edits/combining.
  * **WaveSurfer.js** – perhaps for showing an audio waveform on timeline (optional, visual aid).
  * **Draft.js or Quill** – rich text editors which we might repurpose for transcript editing, though they might not easily support non-linear text removal mapping to media – probably custom solution is needed.
  * **Node packages** – for example, `zoomus` for Zoom API, `googleapis` for Drive, etc.

### 8. **Deployment and Scalability**

For the MVP, we’ll deploy the app on our server (perhaps a Linux VM with sufficient CPU/GPU). Containerization is advisable – we can Dockerize the services (ensuring ffmpeg, python deps, etc. are all set). This will make it easier to install on other agency servers later. We should also document hardware requirements (transcription and video rendering can be heavy; if many users use it concurrently, a GPU for ML and a multi-core CPU for ffmpeg will help).

Our plan is to first use it internally with \~10-20 beta clients. This means we can manage with a single deployment and use feature flags or environment config for certain accounts. As we expand, for each agency that wants their own, we might deploy a separate instance for them (white-label it). Long-term, we might provide an installer or Docker Compose setup so agencies can host themselves. Each instance would have its own database and storage, to keep client data isolated.

Monitoring will be set up to track jobs, CPU usage, etc. If an agency has heavier needs (say they ingest hour-long webinars daily), we might scale by adding more worker containers for processing.

### 9. **Phased Implementation Roadmap**

Given the complexity, we should build this in phases:

* **Phase 1: Core Clipping MVP** – Focus on a single-video input and AI-driven clip suggestions. In this phase, a user can upload a video (or supply a link to one), the system transcribes it (using Whisper API or local), runs a basic highlight selection prompt via GPT-4 (with maybe a fixed prompt or minimal user prompt input), and returns a couple of clip recommendations with transcripts. The user can then adjust start/end on a timeline and export a basic clip (single-track, 16:9 to 9:16 center-crop for example). Essentially, prove out the transcript → AI highlights → clip export pipeline. We can manually integrate with Mixpost at this stage by just instructing user to upload the clip to Mixpost or handle one platform manually, as the scheduling integration can wait until clips are reliably generated.

* **Phase 2: Multi-Track Editing & Prompt Customization** – Introduce handling of two input videos (screen + camera). Implement the composition editor where both tracks can be arranged for vertical output. Also, enable the user to input custom AI prompts before generating suggestions (and perhaps allow re-running the AI with a new prompt to get different results). Introduce transcript-based cutting in the editing UI. By end of this phase, a user should be able to do the majority of what was described: select interesting bits (with AI help), fine-tune the timing and layout, and have a polished vertical clip with an intro text if desired. Start integrating more with Mixpost: e.g., allow the user to enter caption text and choose a social platform to directly publish one clip as a test.

* **Phase 3: Workflow Automation & Additional AI Content** – Now tie everything together for speed: support generating multiple clips in one go (AI finds 5 great clips, user quickly checks/edits them, and all are exported in batch). Implement the scheduling UI fully using Mixpost – so user can schedule those 5 clips across days. Also, add the AI text generation for captions or summaries, and possibly the image generation for thumbnails. This phase makes the product a one-stop content repurposing shop.

* **Phase 4: Integrated Recording & Live Sources** – Develop the in-browser recording studio to capture participants and screens. This is a sizable project on its own (involving WebRTC, possibly STUN/TURN servers, recording handling). We might leverage an existing solution (for example, using Jitsi Meet’s self-hosted server and its recording feature Jibri, or using something like **100ms** or **Daily.co** if we didn’t insist on self-hosted – but since we do, likely Jitsi or custom WebRTC SFU). The goal is to let users bypass Zoom altogether and use our platform to record interviews or presentations. Each participant’s track is saved, and we feed those into the same pipeline. Also in this phase, integrate direct APIs for sources like Zoom/Drive so a user can, from our interface, “Import from Zoom” and just pick a recording (we’d use the Zoom API to fetch it). Riverside’s model of local recording ensures quality; we would replicate that so that an agency could send a link to their client to join a recording session on our app, then proceed to clip it right after.

Throughout these phases, continuous testing with our initial users will guide refinements. We’ll likely need to fine-tune the AI prompts based on real content, optimize the speed of transcription (maybe using faster models or even automatic segmentation to parallelize work on longer videos), and refine the UI for ease of use (since non-technical users like marketing staff should be comfortable using it).

## Conclusion and Feasibility

Building this “OpusClip + Riverside + Mixpost” hybrid is ambitious but very much feasible with today’s technology and open-source tools. Much of the heavy lifting (speech recognition, AI summarization, video encoding) is already solved by existing libraries and models – it’s a matter of **integrating them into a smooth user experience**. We’ve identified key frameworks to leverage: for example, using FFmpeg for video composition will give us a robust “regular video editor” capability programmatically, and referencing projects like FunClip can jumpstart our development for aligning transcripts with clips and even using LLMs for smart cuts. By allowing users to update AI prompts, we ensure the system is not a black box – it becomes a collaborative tool between user and AI, likely leading to better results than a fully automated solution that might miss context.

The end result will be a self-hosted application that **saves tremendous time** in content creation: what once took hours of manually watching footage, finding highlights, cropping/resizing for mobile, adding subtitles, and scheduling posts will be done largely automatically. Agencies can host their own instance, maintain control of their content, and customize the workflows as needed for their niche (something not possible with off-the-shelf SaaS like OpusClip which treats all content generally).

In implementing this, we should remain mindful of performance (video processing can be slow – we’ll use techniques like processing shorter segments, leveraging hardware encoding, etc.) and accuracy (garbage in, garbage out – we need high transcription accuracy and a well-tuned highlight selection to make good clips). But given the current state of AI, we have strong reason to believe we can meet or exceed the quality of existing tools.

This research and plan show that by combining proven components – **accurate transcription** (e.g. Whisper), **LLM-based analysis** (ChatGPT or similar), a **user-friendly editing UI** (inspired by Descript/Riverside), and **open-source scheduling** (Mixpost) – we can create our own powerful video clipping platform. It will empower users to efficiently repurpose long recordings into engaging short-form content, all under their own control and branding. The next step is to start prototyping each piece, validating with sample videos, and iterating towards the fully integrated system. With a step-by-step build and feedback from our initial clients, we can achieve an MVP in the coming months and a stable, installable solution thereafter.

**Sources:** The plan leverages insights from OpusClip’s documented features, Riverside.fm’s feature set (local multitrack recording, Magic Clips, text-based editing), and open-source projects like FunClip which demonstrate local AI clipping with user prompts. We will also integrate Mixpost for scheduling. Technical implementation details such as ffmpeg video stacking and Zoom API usage are informed by community knowledge and documentation. This combination of research gives us confidence in both the vision and the practical roadmap for realization.
